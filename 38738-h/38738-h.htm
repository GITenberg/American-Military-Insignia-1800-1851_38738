<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="pageix" name="pageix"></a>(p. ix)</span> Preface</h2>

<p>This catalog is a descriptive and interpretive listing of the insignia
of the Army of the United States&mdash;other than buttons, epaulets, and
horse furniture&mdash;in the National Collections that were prescribed or
worn during the period 1800-1851. The subject of early American military
buttons has been covered by L. F. Emilio in <i>The Emilio Collection of
Military Buttons</i> (Salem, Massachusetts: Essex Institute, 1911), W. L.
Calver and R. P. Bolton in <i>History Written with Pick and Shovel</i> (New
York: New York Historical Society, 1950), and David F. Johnson in
<i>Uniform Buttons, American Armed Forces</i>, 1784-1948. (Watkins Glen, New
York: Century House, 1948, 2 vols.). For epaulets, see Mendel L.
Peterson, "American Army Epaulets, 1814-1872," <i>Military Collector and
Historian</i> (March 1961, vol. 3, no. 1, pp. 1-14).</p>

<p>Most of the specimens described here are from the huge W. Stokes Kirk
Collection acquired in 1959, supplemented by the War Department
Collection and the numerous biographical collections of the United
States National Museum; in addition, a few insignia in the collections
of J. Duncan Campbell and others are included.</p>

<p>The unique W. Stokes Kirk Collection, unmatched in scope, volume, and
rarity, is worthy of special note. It was begun in 1878 by W. Stokes
Kirk, Sr., of Philadelphia, a dealer in U.S. Government surplus. Struck
by the beautiful design and delicate art work in some of the early
insignia, Mr. Kirk put aside all old and unusual devices for his
personal collection. As his business expanded, so did his interest in
military rarities and curios. After each bulk purchase from government
sources, he would have all the odd and unusual items sorted out for his
examination. The best of such items went into his personal collection,
which included rare firearms, powder flasks, insignia, epaulets,
military caps, and the like. W. Stokes Kirk, Jr., who succeeded his
father and expanded the business nationally until it became almost as
well known as Bannerman's Military Store in New York City, maintained
and enlarged the collection. After his death, in 1946, the collection
was continued by his widow, Mrs. Linnie A. Kirk Mosler. Items in this
catalog from the W. Stokes Kirk Collection are indicated by the letters
"S-K" in parentheses following the United States National Museum number.</p>

<p>Although this catalog is, in more than one sense, a developmental
history of American military insignia, it is not, and is not intended to
be, a definitive study. The picture is far too incomplete. Whereas the
record of Regular Army devices after 1821 is fairly clear&mdash;despite the
fact that the uniform regulations continued sometimes to use the
tantalizing phrase "according to pattern"&mdash;there remain serious gaps in
the pre-1821 period when regulations were exceedingly vague and
fragmentary at best; <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagex" name="pagex"></a>(p. x)</span> for example, the badges of the Regiment of
Light Artillery (1812-1821). These gaps will be filled only by
excavating at sites known to have been occupied by specific Regular
units during particular periods. Indeed, since this study was begun,
four unique and significant insignia were excavated at the site of a War
of 1812 cantonment, and these greatly enrich our knowledge of the
period.</p>

<p>The record of insignia of the veritable multitude of independent
uniformed Militia companies in existence during the period under
consideration may never be complete. The selection presented here,
however, is an excellent representative chronological cross section of
typical designs and variations of insignia worn by the uniformed or
"volunteer" Militia, as opposed to the "common" or "standing" Militia.</p>

<p>The best sources of documentation and dating for Regular Army devices
are the uniform regulations and ordnance regulations; these are
supplemented by pertinent records in the National Archives, notably the
letter files of the Purveyor of Public Supplies and of the Commissary
General of Purchases. The letter files are voluminous, but in some cases
badly mixed and in many cases incomplete. We have conjectured a reason
for this incompleteness. The two prime contractors for military insignia
during the period 1812-1821 were George Armitage and William Crumpton,
both of whom had their small factories in Philadelphia within a mile of
the office of Callendar Irvine, Commissary General of Purchases. The
paucity of written transactions in the records in the National Archives
between these gentlemen and Irvine tends to bear out our assumption that
most of their dealings were conducted verbally in Irvine's office. This
would account for the lack of sketches and drawings of cap plates and
belt plates in files of the National Archives. In cases where no
specific documentary evidence is available, dating has been based on a
careful evaluation of design development and comparison with
biographical specimens that can be more fairly dated through knowledge
of the former owner's career. Excavated insignia from datable sites have
also reduced the problem considerably.</p>

<p>For Militia insignia worn about 1835, the best documentation is to be
found in <i>U.S. Military Magazine</i>, published between 1839 and 1842 by
Huddy and Duval of Philadelphia, and in <i>New York Military Magazine</i>,
published by Labree and Stockton of New York during 1841. In 1939,
Frederick P. Todd described the Huddy and Duval prints in detail
(<i>Journal of the American Military Institute</i>, 1939, vol. 3, no. 3, pp.
166-176). However, evaluation and consideration of over-all design
development and comparison with dated biographical specimens of the
earlier period, before 1835, are difficult and must be done cautiously,
as there is no orderly pattern. One generalization does seem clear:
during the decade after 1821, when the Regulars discarded large cap
plates, the Militia almost universally adopted them and continued to
wear them well into the 1840's. Very few insignia include the maker's
name or initials, but when they do, bracketing within a definite period
is relatively easy. Similarly, when a cap plate appears to be original
to a cap, the design of the cap and its maker's label, if included, are
of great help. Finally, when there is nothing else to rely on, the
"feel" of the specimen, gained through the experience of studying
several thousand, has been used, although with reluctance.</p>

<p>The year 1800 was selected as the opening date of the study because it
was in that year that the first metal ornament was prescribed to
designate a particular branch of service. The closing date of 1851 was
chosen because Regular Army devices for that year and thereafter are
well documented in uniform regulations, manuals, and catalogs of
manufacturers such as William Horstmann and Sons. Militia dress after
that general date becomes so increasingly complex that it should be
attempted only as a separate study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexi" name="pagexi"></a>(p. xi)</span> Most of the specimens described in this study were struck from
steel dies; however&mdash;despite the relative wealth of knowledge on the
striking of coins&mdash;little is known of the exact process, especially
prior to the appearance of the punch press in the 1830's. Several
insignia dies dating as early as the War of 1812 period and a number
dating in the 1840's do exist, however. All of these examined were found
to be female dies, with the design in intaglio rather than in relief.
The design was worked into the die&mdash;the art generally termed
"die-sinking"&mdash;in the same basic manner as in coin dies. The die sinker
first softened the steel to suit his particular taste and then incised
the design, using a succession of small chisels. The steel was then
retempered to withstand high impact pressures. Although there is no
documentation on the subject, manufacturing techniques of the period
indicate that the following process was probably employed: the die was
locked in place at the base of a drop press, similar to a guillotine, so
that it could be struck accurately from above; a piece of pure lead was
then affixed to the bottom of the weighted drop and allowed to strike
the die a sufficient number of times to completely receive the
impression of the die and become, in effect, a male counterpart; lastly,
a thin sheet of brass, copper, or pewter was placed on the female die
and struck with the weighted lead male, receiving the desired impression
but without the excessive stretching and resultant cracking that a
steel-on-steel strike might have produced. Examination of finished
products in the national collections bears out this theory of
production; few if any of the specimens show evidence of having been
struck with a steel male die.</p>

<p>With only a few exceptions, all specimens have been photographed on a
1-inch grid. All references to right and left are made according to
heraldic usage; the heraldic right is always on the left as viewed.</p>

<p>During the months this work has been in progress, many people and
institutions have generously assisted in many ways. It is a pleasure to
thank them for their help.</p>

<p>Mr. Detmar Finke of the Office of the Chief of Military History,
Department of the Army, reviewed the Regular Army portions of the
manuscript and made many valuable suggestions. Mr. Frederick P. Todd,
director of The West Point Museum, graciously answered many questions
relative to both Regular Army and Militia insignia. Through the courtesy
of Mr. James Koping and Miss Elizabeth Ulrich of the Pennsylvania State
Library, The <i>U.S. Military Magazine</i> of Huddy and Duval was made
available for unlimited use.</p>

<p>Thanks are also given to the following, who furnished photographs of
specimens in their collections: Mr. Waverly P. Lewis, Devon,
Connecticut; Mr. William E. Codd, Monkton, Maryland; The Filson Club,
Louisville, Kentucky; The West Point Museum; The Fort Sill Museum; Old
Fort Erie Museum, Ontario, Canada; The Niagara Historical Society
Museum, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, Canada; The Washington County
Historical Society Museum, Fort Calhoun, Nebraska; the Valley Forge
Chapel Museum, and Dr. John Lattimer, New York City.</p>

<p>Mr. Michael Arpad of Washington, D.C., was especially helpful in matters
pertaining to the techniques of chasing and die sinking.</p>

<h1>American<br>
Military Insignia<br>
1800-1851</h1>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3" name="page3"></a>(p. 3)</span> Introduction</h2>

<p>In almost all armies it long has been standard practice to use
distinctive devices of cloth and metal to distinguish between arms and
services, and between individual units of each arm, to enhance morale
and develop esprit de corps. Colors of units of the British Army have
had ancient badges emblazoned on them since before the establishment of
the present standing army in 1661. By the end of the first half of the
18th century some of these badges had been authorized for placement on
horse furniture or for wear on grenadier caps. This was especially true
of the regiments of horse and a few of the older regiments of foot. The
infantry regiments received numerical designations in 1751, and these
numbers were worn on waist belts, shoulder belts, and cartridge-box
plates. When the infantry units acquired county titles in 1782, these
names often were added to the plates. In 1767 regimental numbers were
ordered placed on the buttons of officers and other ranks; in practice
these numbers were often combined with other devices.<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1" title="Go to footnote 1"><span class="smaller">[1]</span></a></p>

<p>In the American Army such devices have taken many forms, ranging from
distinctive buttons, plumes, cockades, cap plates, shoulder-belt plates,
and waist-belt and cartridge-box plates to the well-known shoulder
sleeve insignia and distinctive unit insignia of the present day. The
origin of much of this insignia and many of the changes in its design
can be tied more or less directly to the organization of the Regular
Army&mdash;its contractions and expansions and its changes in arm and service
designations&mdash;and to the peculiar circumstances surrounding the origin
and growth of the volunteer or uniformed Militia. Thus, a short
discussion of the organization of each is in order.<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2" title="Go to footnote 2"><span class="smaller">[2]</span></a></p>

<h3>Organization of the Regular Army</h3>

<p>Two months after the War of the Revolution officially ended with the
signing of a peace treaty on September 3, 1783, General Washington
directed the Army to turn in its arms and disband.<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3" title="Go to footnote 3"><span class="smaller">[3]</span></a> Since the
Continental Congress had made no provision for a permanent
establishment, Washington retained in service one infantry regiment and
a battalion of artillery to guard military stores and take over posts to
be evacuated by the British.<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4" title="Go to footnote 4"><span class="smaller">[4]</span></a> Early in June 1784 Congress ordered
these units disbanded except for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name="page4"></a>(p. 4)</span> detachments to guard stores at
Fort Pitt and West Point; then, in order to secure the frontier against
Indian unrest, it immediately authorized a regiment to be raised from
the militia of four of the States to comprise eight companies of
infantry and two of artillery.<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5" title="Go to footnote 5"><span class="smaller">[5]</span></a> This unit, called the First American
Regiment, gradually turned into a regular organization.</p>

<p>The failure of an expedition commanded by Col. Josiah Harmar of the
First American Regiment against the Indians in 1790 awakened the
Congress somewhat to the threat in the Northwest and resulted in the
organization of another infantry regiment, which was designated the 2d
Infantry Regiment; the First American Regiment was redesignated the
"1st".<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6" title="Go to footnote 6"><span class="smaller">[6]</span></a> Trouble with the Indians continued, and after another severe
reverse Congress authorized the raising of three additional infantry
regiments and, at the same time, empowered the President to organize the
Army as he might see fit.<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7" title="Go to footnote 7"><span class="smaller">[7]</span></a></p>

<p>Under this discretionary power, the Army was reorganized into the Legion
of the United States. This was a field army in which the three combat
branches&mdash;infantry, cavalry, and artillery&mdash;were combined. The Legion
was in turn broken down into four sublegions, with each containing
infantry, cavalry, artillery, and riflemen; thus, the sublegions were
the fore-runners of the modern combined arms team. The 1st and 2d
Infantries became the 1st and 2d Sublegions. Of the three additional
infantry regiments authorized, only two were organized, these becoming
the 3d and 4th Sublegions.<a id="footnotetag8" name="footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8" title="Go to footnote 8"><span class="smaller">[8]</span></a> Under the forceful leadership of Gen.
Anthony Wayne the Legion reversed the record on the frontier and
decisively defeated the Indians at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The
temporary peace which followed turned attention to the problem of
protecting the Atlantic seaboard, and in 1794 Congress authorized a
large increase in the artillery, assigned engineer officers, and
designated the new organization the Corps of Artillerists and
Engineers.<a id="footnotetag9" name="footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9" title="Go to footnote 9"><span class="smaller">[9]</span></a> The Legion was continued until it was replaced in 1796 by
the 1st, 2d, 3d, and 4th Infantry Regiments, which were constituted from
the four sublegions, two troops of light dragoons, and the
above-mentioned Corps.<a id="footnotetag10" name="footnotetag10"></a><a href="#footnote10" title="Go to footnote 10"><span class="smaller">[10]</span></a></p>

<p>The threat of war with France in 1798 brought further expansions. In
April of that year an "additional regiment" of artillerists and
engineers was authorized, with the Corps created in 1794 becoming the
1st and the new unit being designated the 2d Regiment of Artillerists
and Engineers.<a id="footnotetag11" name="footnotetag11"></a><a href="#footnote11" title="Go to footnote 11"><span class="smaller">[11]</span></a> In the following July, 12 more regiments of infantry
and 6 troops of light dragoons&mdash;to be combined with the two troops in
existence to form a regiment&mdash;were authorized; an additional 24
regiments of infantry, plus units of other arms, authorized the
following winter made a total of 40 regiments of infantry.<a id="footnotetag12" name="footnotetag12"></a><a href="#footnote12" title="Go to footnote 12"><span class="smaller">[12]</span></a> Actually,
the greatest part of this force remained on paper. Only the 1st and 2d
Infantries ever attained their required strength, and only 3,400 men
were enlisted for the 5th through the 16th. There were no enlistments at
all for the other regiments. Officers were assigned to the six troops of
light dragoons, but no enlisted personnel were raised and no horses were
bought.<a id="footnotetag13" name="footnotetag13"></a><a href="#footnote13" title="Go to footnote 13"><span class="smaller">[13]</span></a></p>

<p>More quickly than it had arisen, the threat of a war with France abated.
Early in 1800 action was suspended under the two acts creating the paper
regiments, and the Army was reduced to the regular establishment of four
regiments of infantry, two regiments of artillerists and engineers, and
two troops of light dragoons.<a id="footnotetag14" name="footnotetag14"></a><a href="#footnote14" title="Go to footnote 14"><span class="smaller">[14]</span></a> Two years later the antipathy of the
new Jefferson administration to a standing army further reduced this
establishment to two regiments of infantry and one of artillery. The
Corps of Artillerists and Engineers was abolished; a Corps of Engineers
was organized to be stationed at West Point and "constitute a military
academy"; and the light dragoons were disbanded.<a id="footnotetag15" name="footnotetag15"></a><a href="#footnote15" title="Go to footnote 15"><span class="smaller">[15]</span></a></p>

<p>The Jeffersonian theories regarding a strong militia and a small
professional army were rudely shaken in 1807 by the <i>Chesapeake-Leopard</i>
affair. With war seeming imminent, Congress added to the Regular
Establishment, though cautiously "for a limited time," five regiments of
infantry, one regiment of riflemen, one of light artillery, and one of
light dragoons. The new regiments of infantry were numbered the 3d
through <span class="pagenum"><a id="page5" name="page5"></a>(p. 5)</span> the 7th.<a id="footnotetag16" name="footnotetag16"></a><a href="#footnote16" title="Go to footnote 16"><span class="smaller">[16]</span></a> There was no further preparation for a
fight with England until just before war was actually declared. In
January 1812, 10 regiments of infantry, two of artillery, and one
regiment of light dragoons were added; three months later a Corps of
Artificers was organized; and in June provision was made for eight more
infantry regiments, making a total of 25.<a id="footnotetag17" name="footnotetag17"></a><a href="#footnote17" title="Go to footnote 17"><span class="smaller">[17]</span></a> In January 1813, following
the discouragements of the early campaigns in the Northwest, Congress
constituted 20 more infantry regiments, bringing the total to 45, the
largest number in the Regular Establishment until the 20th century.<a id="footnotetag18" name="footnotetag18"></a><a href="#footnote18" title="Go to footnote 18"><span class="smaller">[18]</span></a>
A year later three more regiments of riflemen, designated the 2d through
the 4th, were formed.<a id="footnotetag19" name="footnotetag19"></a><a href="#footnote19" title="Go to footnote 19"><span class="smaller">[19]</span></a></p>

<p>In March 1814 Congress reorganized both the artillery and the dragoons.
The three artillery regiments, which had never operated as such, but
rather by company or detachment, were consolidated into the Corps of
Artillery; and the two regiments of dragoons, which had never been
adequately trained and generally had given a poor account of themselves,
were merged into one.<a id="footnotetag20" name="footnotetag20"></a><a href="#footnote20" title="Go to footnote 20"><span class="smaller">[20]</span></a> The Regiment of Light Artillery remained
untouched.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as the war ended, Congress moved to reduce the Army<a id="footnotetag21" name="footnotetag21"></a><a href="#footnote21" title="Go to footnote 21"><span class="smaller">[21]</span></a>
by limiting the peacetime establishment to 10,000 men, to be divided
among infantry, artillery, and riflemen, plus the Corps of Engineers.
The number of wartime infantry units was reduced to eight, and the rifle
units to one. The Corps of Artillery and the Regiment of Light Artillery
were retained, but dragoons were eliminated.<a id="footnotetag22" name="footnotetag22"></a><a href="#footnote22" title="Go to footnote 22"><span class="smaller">[22]</span></a></p>

<p>By 1821 the prospects of a prolonged peace appeared so good that
Congress felt safe in further reducing the Army. Consequently, in that
year the number of infantry regiments was cut to seven; the Rifle
Regiment was disbanded; the Corps of Artillery and the Regiment of Light
Artillery were disbanded, with four artillery regiments being organized
in their stead; and the Ordnance Department was merged with the
artillery,<a id="footnotetag23" name="footnotetag23"></a><a href="#footnote23" title="Go to footnote 23"><span class="smaller">[23]</span></a> an arrangement that continued until 1832.</p>

<p>The opening of the West in the decades following the War of 1812 brought
an important change in the organization of the Army. Experience having
shown that infantry were at a distinct disadvantage when pitted against
the fleetly mounted Indians, in 1832 a battalion of mounted rangers was
organized to quell disturbances on the northwest frontier,<a id="footnotetag24" name="footnotetag24"></a><a href="#footnote24" title="Go to footnote 24"><span class="smaller">[24]</span></a> but this
loosely knit force was replaced by a regiment of dragoons the following
year.<a id="footnotetag25" name="footnotetag25"></a><a href="#footnote25" title="Go to footnote 25"><span class="smaller">[25]</span></a> The mounted arm had come to stay in the Army.</p>

<p>When the second Seminole War broke out in 1836, a second regiment of
dragoons was organized.<a id="footnotetag26" name="footnotetag26"></a><a href="#footnote26" title="Go to footnote 26"><span class="smaller">[26]</span></a> And, as the war dragged through another
inconclusive year, a reluctant Congress was forced to increase the size
of existing line units and to authorize an additional regiment of
infantry, the 8th. Meanwhile, increasing demands for surveying and
mapping services resulted in the creation of the Corps of Topographical
Engineers as a separate entity.<a id="footnotetag27" name="footnotetag27"></a><a href="#footnote27" title="Go to footnote 27"><span class="smaller">[27]</span></a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the responsibilities of the Army in the opening of the West
continued to increase, and in 1846 the Regiment of Mounted Riflemen was
organized to consolidate the northern route to the Pacific by
establishing and manning a series of posts along the Oregon Trail.<a id="footnotetag28" name="footnotetag28"></a><a href="#footnote28" title="Go to footnote 28"><span class="smaller">[28]</span></a>
However, the outbreak of the War with Mexico postponed this mission.</p>

<p>At the start of the War with Mexico Congress leaned heavily on volunteer
units, with the hard <span class="pagenum"><a id="page6" name="page6"></a>(p. 6)</span> core of the Regulars remaining unchanged.
But early in 1847 it was found necessary to add nine regiments of
infantry and one regiment of dragoons.<a id="footnotetag29" name="footnotetag29"></a><a href="#footnote29" title="Go to footnote 29"><span class="smaller">[29]</span></a> Of the infantry unit's, eight
were of the conventional type; the ninth was formed as the Regiment of
Voltigeurs and Foot Riflemen. Theoretically, only half of this latter
regiment was to be mounted. Each horseman was to be paired with a foot
soldier who was to get up behind and ride double when speed was needed.
In practice, however, none of the Voltigeurs were mounted; the entire
unit fought as foot riflemen.<a id="footnotetag30" name="footnotetag30"></a><a href="#footnote30" title="Go to footnote 30"><span class="smaller">[30]</span></a></p>

<p>All of these new units proved merely creatures of the war, and the
coming of peace saw a reduction to the old establishment of eight
regiments of infantry, four of artillery, two of dragoons, and one
regiment of mounted riflemen.<a id="footnotetag31" name="footnotetag31"></a><a href="#footnote31" title="Go to footnote 31"><span class="smaller">[31]</span></a> This organization remained
substantially unchanged until 1855.<a id="footnotetag32" name="footnotetag32"></a><a href="#footnote32" title="Go to footnote 32"><span class="smaller">[32]</span></a></p>

<h3>Organization of the Militia</h3>

<p>The "common" Militia was first established by the various colonies of
all able-bodied men between roughly the ages of 16 and 60 for protection
against Indian attack. These militiamen were required by law to be
enrolled in the unit of their township or county, furnish their own arms
and equipment, and appear periodically for training. They were civilian
soldiers who had little or no taste for things military, as their
performance in both peace and war almost invariably demonstrated. They
were not uniformed and contributed little or nothing to the field of
military dress.</p>

<p>The "volunteer" or "independent" Militia companies, on the other hand,
were something else again. These units, composed of men who enjoyed
military life, or rather certain aspects of it, appeared rather early in
the Nation's history. The first of these, formed in 1638, was The
Military Company of the Massachusetts, later and better known as the
Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts. By 1750 there
were a number of independent companies in existence&mdash;many of them
chartered&mdash;and membership in them had become a recognized part of the
social life of the larger urban centers.</p>

<p>The concept of volunteer Militia units was confirmed in the Uniform
Militia Act of 1792, which prescribed flank companies of grenadiers,
light infantry, or riflemen for the "common" Militia battalions and a
company of artillery and a troop of horse for each division, to be
formed of volunteers from the Militia at large and to be uniformed and
equipped at the individual volunteer's expense. Thus, from within the
national Militia structure emerged an elite corps of amateur&mdash;as opposed
to civilian&mdash;soldiers who enjoyed military exercise, and the pomp and
circumstance accompanying it, and who were willing to sacrifice both the
time and the money necessary to enjoy it. Since the members were
volunteers, they were ready to submit to discipline up to a point; they
trained rather frequently; many of the officers made an effort to
educate themselves militarily; they chose their own officers; and their
relative permanency gave rise to an excellent esprit de corps. In
actuality, these organizations became private military clubs, and
differed from other male social and fraternal groups only in externals.</p>

<p>The great urban growth of the Nation during the period 1825-1860 was the
golden age of the volunteer companies, and by 1845 these units had all
but supplanted the common Militia. It would be difficult to even
estimate the number of volunteer companies during this period. They
sprang up almost everywhere, more in answer to a demand by the younger
men of the Nation for a recreation that would meet a social and physical
need and by emigrant minorities for a group expression than for reasons
military. It was a "gay and gaudy" Militia, with each unit in its own
distinctive and generally resplendent uniform. If the "Raleigh
Cossacks," the "Hibernia Greens," the "Velvet Light Infantry Company,"
or the "Teutonic Rifles" were more "invincible in peace" than visible in
war, they were a spectacular, colorful, and exciting integral of the
social and military life of the first half of the 19th century.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page7" name="page7"></a>(p. 7)</span> Insignia of the Regular Army</h2>

<p>Uniform regulations prior to 1821 were loosely and vaguely worded, and
this was especially true in regard to officers' insignia. For example
General Orders of March 30, 1800, stated: "... the swords of all
officers, except the generals, to be attached by a white shoulder belt
three inches wide, with an oval plate three inches by two and a half
ornamented with an eagle."<a id="footnotetag33" name="footnotetag33"></a><a href="#footnote33" title="Go to footnote 33"><span class="smaller">[33]</span></a> In 1801 the 1st Infantry Regiment
directed that "the sword ... for platoon officers ... be worn with a
white belt over the coat with a breast plate such as have been by the
Colonel established,"<a id="footnotetag34" name="footnotetag34"></a><a href="#footnote34" title="Go to footnote 34"><span class="smaller">[34]</span></a> and in 1810 a regulation stated that "those
gentlemen who have white sword belts and plates [are] to consider them
as uniform, but those not so provided will be permitted to wear their
waist belts."<a id="footnotetag35" name="footnotetag35"></a><a href="#footnote35" title="Go to footnote 35"><span class="smaller">[35]</span></a> As a result, the officers generally wore what they
wished, and there was a wide variation in design. Most officer insignia
were the product of local jewelers and silversmiths, although some known
specimens are obviously the work of master craftsmen. Quality varied as
well as design, depending on the affluence of the officer concerned.
Some of the plainer plates appear to have been made by rolling silver
dollars into an oval shape.</p>

<p>In regard to enlisted men's insignia, only the descriptions of the 1800
dragoon helmet plate and the 1814 and 1817 riflemen's cap plates give us
anything approaching a clear picture. "Oblong silver plates ... bearing
the name of the corps and the number of the regiment" for the infantry
in 1812, "plates in front" for the 1812 dragoons, and "gilt plate in
front" for the 1812 light artillery are typical examples. As a result,
the establishment of a proper chronology for these devices has depended
on the careful consideration of specimens excavated at posts where
specific units are known to have served at specific times, combined with
research in pertinent records of the period in the National Archives.</p>

<h3>Cap and Helmet Devices</h3>

<h4>DRAGOON HELMET PLATE, 1800</h4>

<p class="center"><i>USNM 66330-M (S-K 86). Figure 1.</i></p>

<a id="img002" name="img002"></a>

<p class="smcap">Figure 1</p>
</div>

<p>The first known distinctive metal branch insignia authorized for the
Army was this helmet plate. General Order, U.S. Army, dated March 30,
1800, prescribed for "Cavalry ... a helmet of leather crowned with black
horse hair and having a brass front, with a mounted dragoon in the act
of charging."<a id="footnotetag36" name="footnotetag36"></a><a href="#footnote36" title="Go to footnote 36"><span class="smaller">[36]</span></a> This oval plate, struck in thin brass with lead-filled
back, has a raised rim, within which is a mounted, helmeted horseman in
the act of charging; overhead is an eagle with a wreath in its beak. A
double-wire fastener soldered to the back is not contemporary.</p>


<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>(p. 8)</span> DRAGOON HELMET PLATE, 1800, DIE SAMPLE</h4>

<p class="center"><i>USNM 60283-M (S-K 41). Figure 2.</i></p>

<a id="img003" name="img003"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img003.jpg" width="300" height="393" alt="" title="">
<p class="smcap">Figure 2</p>
</div>

<p>Although from a different die, this plate, struck in thin brass, appears
to be a die sample of the plate described above. It is also possible
that it is a sample of the dragoon plate authorized in 1812.</p>

<p class="p2"> The 1813 uniform regulations specified for enlisted men of the
artillery a "black leather cockade, with points 4 inches in diameter, a
yellow button and eagle in the center, the button in uniform with the
coat button."<a id="footnotetag37" name="footnotetag37"></a><a href="#footnote37" title="Go to footnote 37"><span class="smaller">[37]</span></a> This specification gives some validity to the belief
that a cockade with an approximation of the artillery button tooled on
it may also have been worn.</p>



<h4>LEATHER COCKADE, ARTILLERY, C. 1808-1812</h4>

<p class="center"><i>USNM 60256-M (S-K 14). Figure 3.</i></p>

<a id="img004" name="img004"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img004.jpg" width="300" height="363" alt="" title="">
<p class="smcap">Figure 3</p>
</div>

<p>This cockade is of black leather of the size prescribed by the 1813
regulations. Tooled into the upper fan is an eagle-on-cannon device with
a stack of 6 cannon balls under the trail; an arc of 15 stars partially
surrounds the eagle device. It is believed to have been worn on
artillery <i>chapeaux de bras</i> as early as 1808.</p>

<p>The specimen is unmarked as to maker, but from correspondence of
Callendar Irvine, Commissary General of Purchases from 1812 to 1841, it
seems very possible that cockades similar to this one were made by
Robert Dingee of New York City. Dingee is first listed in New York
directories as a "saddler" (1812); he is listed later as "city weigher"
(1828) and "inspector of green hides" (1831). The eagle-on-cannon design
is similar to that of several Regular artillery buttons worn between
1802 and 1821, but it most closely approximates a button Johnson assigns
to the period 1794-1810.<a id="footnotetag38" name="footnotetag38"></a><a href="#footnote38" title="Go to footnote 38"><span class="smaller">[38]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"> The question has been raised as to whether the Regulars ever wore a
cockade with such a device. The 1813 and 1814 uniform regulations merely
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>(p. 9)</span> specified black leather cockades of 4 inches and 4-1/2 inches in
diameter respectively. However, since the Militia generally did not
start adopting Regular Army devices until the 1820's it seems probable
that this cockade was an item of Regular Army issue, despite the lack of
evidence of specific authorization.</p>

<p>As early as January 1799 War Office orders specified: "All persons
belonging to the Army, to wear a black cockade, with a small white eagle
in the center. The cockade of noncommissioned officers, musicians, and
privates to be of leather with Eagles of tin."<a id="footnotetag39" name="footnotetag39"></a><a href="#footnote39" title="Go to footnote 39"><span class="smaller">[39]</span></a> This regulation was
repeated in 1800.<a id="footnotetag40" name="footnotetag40"></a><a href="#footnote40" title="Go to footnote 40"><span class="smaller">[40]</span></a> By 1802 these cockade eagles had taken the colors
used for the buttons and lace of the different arms. The Purveyor of
Public Supplies in that year purchased cockade eagles in tin (white) for
infantry and in brass (yellow) for artillery enlisted men at a cost of
one and two cents, respectively.<a id="footnotetag41" name="footnotetag41"></a><a href="#footnote41" title="Go to footnote 41"><span class="smaller">[41]</span></a> The cockade eagles of infantry
officers were to be of silver and those of artillery officers of gold.
Cockades for company officers and enlisted personnel were to be of
leather. The loosely worded regulation of 1813 infers that field
officers' cockades might be of silk similar to the "black Ribbon"
binding specified for their hats.<a id="footnotetag42" name="footnotetag42"></a><a href="#footnote42" title="Go to footnote 42"><span class="smaller">[42]</span></a></p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to determine whether cockade eagles are of
Regular Army or Militia origin, and to date them if the latter. They
have been found in a wide variety of design and size, ranging from the
rather plain example (fig. <a href="#img007">6</a>) to the highly refined one on the general
officer's <i>chapeau de bras</i> (fig. <a href="#img005">4</a>). Examination of hats worn by both
Regulars and Militia prior to 1821 reveals that there is little to
choose between the eagles worn by the two components. After 1821,
however, when Militia insignia tended to become more ornate and Regular
devices more uniform, some of the Militia specimens emerge as distinct
types because they have no Regular counterparts. Origin of the specimen,
including excavations of military cantonment sites where the make-up of
the garrison can be determined, has been the primary criterion used in
assignment to either Regular Army or Militia, and to a lesser extent in
dating. Over-all design and method of manufacture have also been
considered in dating.</p>

<p>Unusually refined in design, the eagle is of gold, with head to right,
federal shield on breast, and olive branch in right talon. Three arrows,
with points outward, are held in left talon.</p>

<p>This cockade eagle is on a <i>chapeau de bras</i> formerly belonging to Peter
Gansevoort, brigadier general of the New York State Militia and
brigadier general, U.S. Army, 1809-1812. Although Gansevoort wore this
<i>chapeau</i> while serving as a Militia officer, as evidenced by a New York
State button attached to it, this eagle is included with Regular Army
devices because it is typical of those probably worn by high-ranking
officers of both components.</p>

<p>Cast in pewter and gold-finished, this eagle looks to the right, stands
on clouds, and holds three arrows (facing inward) in the right talon and
an upright olive branch in the left.</p>

<p>The eagle-on-clouds design is first seen on coins on the 1795 silver
dollar.<a id="footnotetag43" name="footnotetag43"></a><a href="#footnote43" title="Go to footnote 43"><span class="smaller">[43]</span></a> It was popular during the War of 1812 period, and was not
used in new designs by the Regular Army after 1821. Eagles of identical
design and size are also known in pewter without finish. Such an eagle
could have been worn by Militia as well as Regulars. Similar specimens
have been excavated at Regular Army cantonment sites of the period.</p>


<h4>COCKADE EAGLE, OFFICERS, 1800-1821</h4>

</div>

<p>This cockade eagle, which is struck in thin brass and silvered, was
excavated on the site of a War of 1812 cantonment. Comparison with
similar specimens in other collections indicates that the missing head
was turned to the right. This eagle is classed as an officer's device
because of its silvered brass composition. The elements comprising the
arc on which the eagle stands cannot be identified because of the
lightness of the strike.</p>

<p class="p2"> When the dragoons were disbanded in the 1802 reduction following the
dissipation of the French scare, distinctive hat devices other than
cockades <span class="pagenum"><a id="page11" name="page11"></a>(p. 11)</span> disappeared from the service. In 1808, when the Army
was increased, the newly constituted regiments of light dragoons, light
artillery, and riflemen were authorized to wear leather caps. The cap
devices for these units were prescribed as Roman letters, "<span class="smcap">U.S.L.D.</span>,"
"<span class="smcap">U.S.L.A.</span>," and "<span class="smcap">U.S.R.R</span>.," rather than plates. The letters were to be
of brass, 1-1/2 inches "in length."<a id="footnotetag44" name="footnotetag44"></a><a href="#footnote44" title="Go to footnote 44"><span class="smaller">[44]</span></a></p>

<a id="img008" name="img008"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img008.jpg" width="300" height="305" alt="" title="">
<p><span class="smcap">Figure 7.</span>&mdash;Specimens in Campbell collection.</p>
</div>

<p>Illustrated in figure 7 are the letters "<span class="smcap">U</span>" and "<span class="smcap">L</span>", of brass, slightly
more than 1 inch "in length" and a letter <span class="smcap">d</span>, of pewter, 1 inch "in
length." The latter was excavated at Sackets Harbor, New York, where
elements of the light artillery dragoons and riflemen are known to have
served during 1813 and 1814. It seems obvious that pewter letters were
worn by the dragoons as consonant with their other trimmings, for in
July 1812 Col. James Burn of the 2d Light Dragoons requested official
permission to issue such.<a id="footnotetag45" name="footnotetag45"></a><a href="#footnote45" title="Go to footnote 45"><span class="smaller">[45]</span></a></p>

<p>With the large increase in the Army in 1812 came a change in the
headgear of some corps and also a change in insignia. The light
artillery was to wear a yoeman-crowned (i.e., wider at the crown than at
the base) black cap with "gilt plate in front," and the infantry platoon
officers and enlisted men were finally to have the black cylindrical
caps (first prescribed in 1810) with "an oblong silver plate in front of
the cap bearing the name of the corps and number of the regiment."<a id="footnotetag46" name="footnotetag46"></a><a href="#footnote46" title="Go to footnote 46"><span class="smaller">[46]</span></a>
The rifle platoon officers and enlisted men were also to wear infantry
caps, but with yellow trimmings.<a id="footnotetag47" name="footnotetag47"></a><a href="#footnote47" title="Go to footnote 47"><span class="smaller">[47]</span></a> The dragoons were authorized
"helmets" with "plates" in 1812, and the foot artillery regiments in the
fall of the same year were ordered to wear caps like the light artillery
instead of the <i>chapeaux de bras</i> previously worn, which would have
necessitated the use of plates.</p>

<p>The foot units received their new insignia almost immediately, the cap
plates having been designed, contracted for, and delivered by late
February 1812 for the 5th, 6th, 12th, and 15th Infantry Regiments<a id="footnotetag48" name="footnotetag48"></a><a href="#footnote48" title="Go to footnote 48"><span class="smaller">[48]</span></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page12" name="page12"></a>(p. 12)</span> (the latter two were new units). This rapid action in regard to
the infantry plates appears to be strong witness to the emphasis placed
on distinctive insignia as morale factors and aids to enlistment, for
active recruiting for the 10 new regiments did not begin until several
months later. There were three different patterns of this infantry plate
manufactured and issued, two of which are described below.</p>

<p>All arms were wearing cap plates by the middle of 1813, for there is
record of such issue to the dragoons as well as record of rejection of
ill-struck specimens for infantry, artillery, and rifles.<a id="footnotetag49" name="footnotetag49"></a><a href="#footnote49" title="Go to footnote 49"><span class="smaller">[49]</span></a> These
plates were made variously by William Crumpton and George Armitage of
Philadelphia, and Aaron M. Peasley of Boston.<a id="footnotetag50" name="footnotetag50"></a><a href="#footnote50" title="Go to footnote 50"><span class="smaller">[50]</span></a> Philadelphia
directories list Crumpton as a button maker and silversmith between 1811
and 1822. Armitage is first listed in Philadelphia directories, in 1800,
as a "silver plate worker"; in 1801 he is listed as "silverplater," and
in 1820 as a "silverplater and military ornament maker." Peasley was an
ornament and insignia maker in Boston during the same period.<a id="footnotetag51" name="footnotetag51"></a><a href="#footnote51" title="Go to footnote 51"><span class="smaller">[51]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"> The three types of infantry cap plates issued between 1812 and 1814
are somewhat similar, and all carry the prescribed "name of the corps
and number of the regiment." All three specimens of these types are
ground finds, two having been excavated after this work was in draft.
The first pictured specimen (fig. <a href="#img009">8</a>, left) is believed to be the
earliest pattern issued. Infantry plates as specified in the regulations
were contracted for with William Crumpton late in 1811 or early 1812 by
Tench Coxe, Purveyor of Public Supplies, and issued to troop units not
later than the early summer.<a id="footnotetag52" name="footnotetag52"></a><a href="#footnote52" title="Go to footnote 52"><span class="smaller">[52]</span></a> They had been in use but a few months
when their generally poor quality of composition forced several
regimental commanders to complain to the new Commissary General of
Purchases, Callendar Irvine, who had just superseded Coxe, and to
request something better. Irvine approved, and he let a contract for new
plates with George Armitage of Philadelphia.<a id="footnotetag53" name="footnotetag53"></a><a href="#footnote53" title="Go to footnote 53"><span class="smaller">[53]</span></a> Irvine's reaction to
the matter of the plates is an example of his opinion of his
predecessor, Coxe, and Coxe's work in general, which he had observed
while serving as Superintendent of Military Stores in Philadelphia. In
replying to the complaint of Colonel Simonds, commanding officer of the
6th Infantry, Irvine wrote: "The plates are mere tin, in some respects
like the man who designed and contracted for them, differing to him only
as to durability ... I am contracting for a plate of decent composition
to issue with your next year's clothing."<a id="footnotetag54" name="footnotetag54"></a><a href="#footnote54" title="Go to footnote 54"><span class="smaller">[54]</span></a></p>

<p>The first pattern carries the "name of the corps and the number of the
regiment," the 15th Infantry, commanded by Col. Zebulon Pike who was one
of the officers who complained to Irvine about the poor quality of cap
plates. The specimen is of tinned iron and the letters and numerals have
been struck with individual hand dies.</p>

<p>The two Armitage plates, very similar in over-all design (figures 8,
right, and 9), have been designated the second and third patterns. At
least one of these&mdash;perhaps both&mdash;apparently was designed by, and its
die sunk by, Moritz Furst, well-known die sinker and designer of
Philadelphia. On March 6, 1813, Irvine wrote the Secretary of War: "Mr.
Furst executed a die for this office for striking infantry cap plates,
designed by him, which has been admitted by judges to be equal, if not
superior, to anything of the kind ever produced in this country."<a id="footnotetag55" name="footnotetag55"></a><a href="#footnote55" title="Go to footnote 55"><span class="smaller">[55]</span></a>
Furst was Hungarian by birth. He studied design and die sinking at the
mint in Vienna and came to the United States in 1807 with the
expectation of becoming Chief Engraver at the Philadelphia Mint, an
appointment which he did not receive. He sank the dies for many of the
medals voted to War of 1812 leaders, did the obverse die work for a
number of Indian peace medals, and is believed to have designed the
swords given by the State of New York to Generals Brown, Scott, Gaines,
and Macomb.<a id="footnotetag56" name="footnotetag56"></a><a href="#footnote56" title="Go to footnote 56"><span class="smaller">[56]</span></a></p>

<p class="nofloat">This is the second pattern of the infantry cap plate described in the
1812 regulations as an "oblong silver plate ... bearing the name of the
corps and the number of the regiment." The specimen was excavated on the
site of Smith's Cantonment at Sackets Harbor, New York, known to have
been occupied by Regular infantry during the 1812-1815 period. The piece
is struck in "white metal" and tinned [the term "silver" in the
regulation referred only to color]. It is rectangular, with clipped
corners, and is dominated by an eagle, with wings outspread, grasping
lightning bolts in the right talon and an olive branch in the left
talon. Below is a panoply of stacked arms, flags with 6-pointed stars,
two drums, and a cartridge box marked "<span class="smcap">U.S.</span>" The corps designation "<span class="smcap">U.S.

"<span class="smcap">REGT.</span>" on the left. The plate is pierced with four pairs of holes on
each side for attachment.</p>

<p>This is the third pattern of the infantry cap plate prescribed in the
1812 regulations. Like the preceding plate, of the second pattern, the
original plate from which this reproduction was made was excavated on
the site of Smith's Cantonment at Sackets Harbor, New York. Made of
tin-alloy, as is the original, and rectangular with clipped corners, the
piece is dominated by an unusually fierce looking eagle that first
appeared on one of the 1807 half-dollars struck <span class="pagenum"><a id="page14" name="page14"></a>(p. 14)</span> at the
Philadelphia Mint. The eagle has an out-sized, curved upper beak and is
grasping lightning bolts in the right talon and an olive branch in the
left. Below is a panoply of flags and muskets with drum, saber, and
cartridge box. The corps designation "<span class="smcap">US INFAN<sup>Y</sup>.</span>" is above, and the
unit designation "<span class="smcap">16 REG<sup>T</sup></span>" is below. The "16" appears to have been
added with separate die strikes. The specimen is pierced with two pairs
of holes on each side for attachment.</p>

<p>This third pattern was also struck in brass and silvered for wear by
officers. Several fragments of such a plate were excavated at Sackets
Harbor; these, although of the third pattern, are the product of a die
different from that used in striking the piece described above.</p>


<h4>DRAGOON CAP PLATE, 1812</h4>

<img src="images/img012.jpg" width="300" height="401" alt="" title="">
<p class="smcap">Figure 10</p>
</div>

<p>This is an almost exact duplicate of the 1800 dragoon plate except that
it is struck in pewter, "white metal," the color used by the infantry
and dragoons. It is rectangular with clipped corners that are pierced
for attachment. No detailed description of the 1812 plate has ever been
found, but several identical specimens are known attached to dragoon
helmets made by a contractor named Henry Cressman. The name "Cressman"
is stamped on the lower side of the visor alongside the initials of an
inspector named George Flomerfelt, who is known to have been employed by
the Army as an inspector in Philadelphia during the period. Henry
Cressman is listed in the Philadelphia directories from 1807 through
1817 as a shoemaker. From 1825 to 1839 he is listed as a military cap
maker.</p>

<p class="p2"> On January 12, 1814, Irvine wrote to the Secretary of War as follows:
"I send herewith an infantry cap plate which, with your permission, I
will substitute for that now in use. The advantages of the former over
the latter are that it is lighter, neater, and will not cost half [the]
price. The present plate covers the greater part of the front of the
cap, is heavy in its <span class="pagenum"><a id="page15" name="page15"></a>(p. 15)</span> appearance, and adds much to the weight of
the cap ...<a id="footnotetag57" name="footnotetag57"></a><a href="#footnote57" title="Go to footnote 57"><span class="smaller">[57]</span></a>" This proposal was approved on January 18.<a id="footnotetag58" name="footnotetag58"></a><a href="#footnote58" title="Go to footnote 58"><span class="smaller">[58]</span></a></p>

</div>

<p class="nofloat">But here we enter an area of some confusion and controversy. Were these
new plates to carry the name of the corps and/or the number of the
regiment? Irvine's correspondence gives us no clue, but on the following
March 28 he wrote at least two of his deputy commissary generals that he
was forwarding 8,752 plates for distribution to 14 specifically named
infantry regiments plus 851 "blank" plates.<a id="footnotetag59" name="footnotetag59"></a><a href="#footnote59" title="Go to footnote 59"><span class="smaller">[59]</span></a> From the total of 8,752
forwarded for specific units, it would seem that these were probably
plates of the new design, but then the variance in the number sent for
individual regiments&mdash;from a low of 152 for the 5th Infantry to highs of
1,016 and 1,050 for the 19th and 25th, respectively&mdash;appears odd.
Specimens of the 1812 pattern are known both with and without the
regimental number, while no examples of the 1814 pattern have been found
with unit designation. Two extant examples of the 1814 pattern,
representing two very similar but distinct designs (figs. 11, 12), were
excavated at Sackets Harbor, New York, and Fort Atkinson, Nebraska,
where Regular infantry served during 1813-1816 and 1819-1821,
respectively. Both plates are "blank," and there is no appropriate place
on either for the addition of the number of the unit, as in the case of
the 1812 pattern.</p>

<p>Another example of the 1814 pattern is known; it is attached to a
bell-crowned cap of Militia origin, which indicates that the plate was
adopted by the Militia after being discarded by the Regular
Establishment. A plate of the same design, but struck in pewter and cut
in the diamond shape popular in the 1820's and 1830's, is also known; it
is obviously a Militia item.</p>

<p>Like practically all die samples, this one is struck in brass. It is
rectangular with unclipped corners, but <span class="pagenum"><a id="page16" name="page16"></a>(p. 16)</span> is marked for clipping.
Within a raised oval an eagle, very similar to that on the 1812 plate,
carries an olive branch in its beak, three arrows in its right talon,
and thunder bolts and lightning in its left talon; below, there is a
trophy of stacked muskets, drum, flag, and shield. Although this
specimen is struck in brass, the plate in used specimens is known only
in silver on copper, despite the fact that there was considerable talk
of issuing it in brass.<a id="footnotetag60" name="footnotetag60"></a><a href="#footnote60" title="Go to footnote 60"><span class="smaller">[60]</span></a></p>

<p>This plate, which is original to the hat to which it is affixed, may
well have been worn by a regular infantry officer during the period
1814-1821. The cap is of the style first issued in October 1813, with
the front rising above the crown.<a id="footnotetag61" name="footnotetag61"></a><a href="#footnote61" title="Go to footnote 61"><span class="smaller">[61]</span></a></p>

<p>The plate, of silver on copper, is rectangular with four scallops top
and bottom. A floral border, 3/16 of an inch wide, that surrounds the
whole, strongly suggests that it was an officer's plate. Within a
central oval an eagle, with wings outspread, is superimposed upon a
trophy of arms and flags; above, on a ribbon, are "<span class="smcap">E PLURIBUS UNUM</span>" and
15 5-pointed stars. It is possible that this plate is a Militia item,
but the fact that it appears to be original on a leather cap of the type
worn by Regulars makes it more likely that it is another example of
officers' license in the matter of insignia during this period. Its
attachment to the cap is a variant method: two hasp-like metal loops,
affixed to the plate, have been run through holes in the hat and a
leather thong threaded <span class="pagenum"><a id="page17" name="page17"></a>(p. 17)</span> through them. Most cap plates of this
period were pierced at the corners for attachment by threads.</p>

<p class="p2 nofloat"> The cap plates issued to the artillery regiments (less the Regiment of
Light Artillery) and the riflemen during the period 1812-1821 are known,
but only a fragment of one is represented in the national collections.
Illustrations of all extant are included to complete the picture. Two of
the 1812 plates issued the 2d Regiment of Artillery (fig. <a href="#img017">15</a>) have been
excavated at Fort Erie, Ontario, and are in the collections of the
museum there. A plate of the 3d Regiment (fig. <a href="#img018">16</a>) excavated at Sackets
Harbor, New York, is of an entirely different design. The lower third of
a plate of the 1st Regiment (fig. <a href="#img019">17</a>), again of a different design, was
excavated by the authors in 1961. In 1814, when the three regiments were
consolidated into the Corps of Artillery, these plates were superseded
by one bearing the eagle-on-cannon device closely resembling the button
of the artillery for the period 1814-1821, which has the word "Corps"
inscribed.<a id="footnotetag62" name="footnotetag62"></a><a href="#footnote62" title="Go to footnote 62"><span class="smaller">[62]</span></a> Specimens of this latter plate representing two distinct
though similar designs have been excavated at posts known to have been
manned by Regular artillery in 1814 and later (figs. 18, 19). The same
general design appears also on cross-belt plates and waist-belt plates
(see below pp. <a href="#page34">34</a>-35).</p>


<h4>CAP PLATE, 1ST REGIMENT ARTILLERY, 1812</h4>

<p>The over-all design of the plate of which this brass-struck fragment
represents approximately one-third can be rather accurately surmised by
comparing it with several of the ornamented buttons issued to the
infantry in 1812-1815. It is probably the work of the same designer.<a id="footnotetag63" name="footnotetag63"></a><a href="#footnote63" title="Go to footnote 63"><span class="smaller">[63]</span></a>
The plate is rectangular with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page18" name="page18"></a>(p. 18)</span> clipped corners. Within a raised
border is an oval surrounded by cannon, cannon balls, and a drum, with
the unit designation "1 <span class="smcap">R<sup>T</sup> ART<sup>Y</sup></span>". At the top of the oval can be seen
grasping claws, obviously those of an eagle (as sketched in by the
artist) and similar to those on the buttons referred to above. Single
holes at the clipped corners provided means of attachment. It seems
probable that the design of the missing portion also include flags and
additional arms and accoutrements.</p>

<p class="p2"> The design of the "yellow front plate" authorized and issued to the
Regiment of Light Artillery<a id="footnotetag64" name="footnotetag64"></a><a href="#footnote64" title="Go to footnote 64"><span class="smaller">[64]</span></a> in 1812 was unknown for many years. In
May 1961 one of the authors fortunately located this plate (fig. <a href="#img022">20</a>) in
the collections of the Niagara Historical Society Museum at
Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, included in a group of British badges of
the War of 1812 period. There can be no doubt that the specimen is
American: the eagle's head is of the same design as that on the third
pattern 1812 infantry cap plate (fig. <a href="#img011">9</a>); the wreath of laurel appears
on both the 1800 and 1812 dragoon helmet plates; and the thunderbolts in
the eagle's right talon are wholly American, as opposed to British, and
are of the period. In the Fort Ticonderoga Museum collections there is a
gold signet ring (original owner unknown) that has an almost identical
design.</p>

<p>This is one of the largest plates ever worn by the Regular
Establishment. It measures 4-1/4 by 5-1/4 inches, and it is not
surprising that it was replaced because of its size. On May 19, 1814,
the Commissary General of Purchases wrote Lt. Col. J. R. Fenwick,
second-in-command of the light artillery, asking his opinion of a new
design and stating flatly: "The present light artillery plate is too
large by one-half."<a id="footnotetag65" name="footnotetag65"></a><a href="#footnote65" title="Go to footnote 65"><span class="smaller">[65]</span></a> The plate illustrated as figure 21 is offered as

<p class="nofloat">There are four different patterns of riflemen's cap plates that can be
fairly bracketed in three periods. The large (6-1/4 by 5 inches)
diamond-shaped brass plate with the letters "R.R." (fig. <a href="#img024">22</a>) was adopted
for wear in the spring of 1812 as replacement for the letters "<span class="smcap">USRR</span>"
that had been worn on the cap since the organization of the Regiment of
Riflemen in 1808. It was excavated in the interior of one of the
barracks comprising Smith's Cantonment at Sackets Harbor, New York,
where riflemen were stationed as early as August 1812. The style of the
"R" is very similar to that on the 1812 Artillery cap plate, and the
"<span class="smcap">R.R.</span>" designation conforms to that on the button authorized for the
riflemen in 1808. The pattern of the second diamond-shaped plate (fig.
<a href="#img025">23</a>), also in brass and almost identical in size, although a ground find,
is more difficult to account for, despite the fact that it most
certainly falls in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page20" name="page20"></a>(p. 20)</span> same period. The most logical
explanation seems that the riflemen, who considered themselves a cut
above the common infantry, became disgruntled with the utter plainness
of their plates when compared with those just issued the infantry, and
asked for and received, possibly late in 1812, the plate with the eagle
and the designation "U.S. Rifle Men." The fact that the plate bears the
designation "1 <span class="smcap">REG<sup>T</sup></span>"&mdash;although there were no other rifle regiments from
1812 to 1814&mdash;can be explained by reference to the "national color" of
the Rifle Regiment completed in 1808, which bore the inscription "1st
Rifle Regt.&mdash;U.S." and the standard and national color of the light
artillery which were inscribed "The First Regiment of Light Artillery"
when there was never more than one light artillery unit in the Army.<a id="footnotetag66" name="footnotetag66"></a><a href="#footnote66" title="Go to footnote 66"><span class="smaller">[66]</span></a>
In any case, accurate dating of the third and fourth patterns definitely
places the second pattern in the 1812-1813 period by process of
elimination. It was superseded in 1814<a id="footnotetag67" name="footnotetag67"></a><a href="#footnote67" title="Go to footnote 67"><span class="smaller">[67]</span></a> very possibly for the same
reason that the infantry plate was changed&mdash;heaviness in both appearance
and weight&mdash;and replaced by a plate with a "design similar to that of
the button ... flat yellow buttons which shall exhibit a bugle
surrounded by stars with the number of the regiment within the curve of
the bugle."<a id="footnotetag68" name="footnotetag68"></a><a href="#footnote68" title="Go to footnote 68"><span class="smaller">[68]</span></a> At least three specimens of this third-pattern plate are
known. They all are 3-1/4 inches in diameter, and thus are large enough
for a hat frontpiece and too large to be a cockade device. One of these
plates is without a numeral (fig. <a href="#img026">24</a>); one has the numeral "1," and one
has the numeral "4" (fig. <a href="#img027">25</a>). The first and second of these were found
at Fort Atkinson, but very probably were not worn as late as 1819-1821.
Portions of specimens of this 1814 plate have also been recovered from
an early Pawnee village site in Webster County, Nebraska, indicating
their possible use as trade goods after the rifle regiment changed its
plates in 1817.<a id="footnotetag69" name="footnotetag69"></a><a href="#footnote69" title="Go to footnote 69"><span class="smaller">[69]</span></a> The fourth pattern, with an eagle over a horn (fig.
<a href="#img028">26</a>) was authorized<a id="footnotetag70" name="footnotetag70"></a><a href="#footnote70" title="Go to footnote 70"><span class="smaller">[70]</span></a> in 1817. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page21" name="page21"></a>(p. 21)</span> Apparently it was worn until
1821, since several examples of it have been found at Atkinson; other
examples also are known.</p>

<p class="nofloat">The cap plate for the U.S. Military Academy, c. 1815, is illustrated
(fig. <a href="#img029">27</a>) because it completes the cycle for insignia of the Regular
Establishment for the period. Apparently it is the work of the same
designer as most of the insignia of the period 1812-1815. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page22" name="page22"></a>(p. 22)</span>
Scratched on its reverse side is the name George W. Frost, a Virginian
who entered the Military Academy as a cadet in 1814 and resigned on
March 8, 1816.</p>

<p>The two plates of the U.S. Marine Corps, despite the fact that they are
naval rather than military, are included because they fit very precisely
into the device design pattern of the strictly army items of the period
and because they are unique in their rarity.</p>


<h4>CAP PLATE, U.S. MARINE CORPS, C. 1807, DIE SAMPLE</h4>

<p>This specimen was extremely puzzling for many years. The design is
obviously that of the War of 1812 period, bearing strong similarity to
both the 1812 and 1814 infantry plates and the 1814 Artillery Corps
plate, possibly the work of the same die sinker. The 1804 Marine Corps
uniform regulations specified merely a "Brass Eagle and Plate," but the
1807 regulations called for "Octagon plates."<a id="footnotetag71" name="footnotetag71"></a><a href="#footnote71" title="Go to footnote 71"><span class="smaller">[71]</span></a> Thus there was
considerable reluctance to accept this die sample as the authentic
design. In the summer of 1959, however, the authors, excavating at Fort
Tomkins, New York, which was known to have had a small barracks for the
use of naval personnel ashore, recovered parts of two brass plates of
this identical design, and in the octagon shape&mdash;that is, rectangular
with clipped corners (fig. <a href="#img031">29</a>). The design may thus be precisely dated.</p>

<a id="img031" name="img031"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img031.jpg" width="300" height="321" alt="" title="">
<p class="smcap">Figure 29</p>
</div>

<p>The specimen is struck in rectangular brass with a raised edge. The
whole is dominated by an eagle that is very similar to the eagles on the
infantry and artillery corps plates described above. The talons grasp
the shank of a large fouled anchor; a ribbon, held in the beak and
streaming overhead, is embossed with the motto "<span class="smcap">FORTITUDINE.</span>" The whole
is on a trophy of arms and flags, and below the lower raised edge is
embossed the word "<span class="smcap">MARINES.</span>" The excavated specimens vary slightly in
size, but average 3-3/8 by 4-3/4 inches. Reproductions of this die
strike were made prior to its acquisition by the National Museum, and
specimens outside the national collections should be considered with
caution.</p>


<h4>CAP OR SHOULDER-BELT PLATE, U.S. MARINE CORPS, 1815-1825(?)</h4>

<p class="center"><i>USNM 58671-N-(2). Figure 30.</i></p>

<p class="smcap">Figure 30</p>
</div>

<p>This specimen is known only in die samples. Because of its similarity in
design to the 1814 infantry <span class="pagenum"><a id="page23" name="page23"></a>(p. 23)</span> plates, it cannot be dated later
than 1825. Since no naval uniformed Militia units are known for the
period 1815-1825, and since the plate is obviously not a device of the
regular Navy, it must be assigned to the Marine Corps. In studying this
plate, however, we must recognize the possibility that the maker may
have been designing and sinking dies in the hope of having a sample
accepted and approved for issue rather than actually executing a
contract. The plate is struck in rectangular brass, and the corners are
marked for clipping. The design, within a wide oval with raised edge,
consists of an eagle above a trophy of arms, flags, and a shield. The
right talon grasps a fluke of a fouled anchor, and the left talon holds
the pike of a stand of colors. Reproductions of this die strike were
made prior to its acquisition by the National Museum, and specimens
outside the national collections should be considered with caution.</p>

<p class="p2"> The 1821 uniform regulations were significant in several respects: cap
plates were eliminated as distinctive insignia of the various arms; the
color of certain items of dress and equipment remained the sole
distinction; and the rules regarding nonregulation dress were more
precisely stated than before. The cap plates were replaced by eagles,
measuring 3 inches between wing tips, and the number of the regiment was
cut in the shield. Regulations tersely stated that "all articles of
uniform or equipment, more or less, than those prescribed, or in any
manner differing from them, are prohibited."<a id="footnotetag72" name="footnotetag72"></a><a href="#footnote72" title="Go to footnote 72"><span class="smaller">[72]</span></a> General and staff
officers were to wear black sword belts with "yellow plates"; artillery
officers were to wear white waist belts with a yellow oval plate 1-1/2
inches wide and with an eagle in the center; infantry officers were to
wear a similar plate that was white instead of yellow. Cockade eagles
for <i>chapeau de bras</i> were to be gold and measure 1-1/2 inches between
wing tips. Since enlisted men were no longer authorized to wear swords,
they had no waist belts.</p>


<h4>CAP AND PLATE, THIRD ARTILLERY, 1821</h4>

<p>Although several "yellow" eagles that can be attributed to the 1821-1832
period are known, this brass specimen on the bell-crowned cap is the
only one known to the authors that has the prescribed regimental number
cut out of the shield. The button on the pompon rosette&mdash;which appears
to be definitely original to the cap, as does the eagle&mdash;carries the
artillery "A," thus the assignment to that branch of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page24" name="page24"></a>(p. 24)</span> the
service. The eagle bears a close similarity to the eagles on the 1812
and 1814 infantry cap plates and the 1807 Marine Corps cap plate, and is
possibly the work of the same designer.</p>


<h4>CAP INSIGNIA, INFANTRY, 1822</h4>

<p>Early in 1822, the Secretary of War, acting on a suggestion of Callendar
Irvine, ordered that all metal equipment of the infantry be of "white
metal" in keeping with its pompons, tassels, and lace.<a id="footnotetag73" name="footnotetag73"></a><a href="#footnote73" title="Go to footnote 73"><span class="smaller">[73]</span></a> This
specimen, struck in copper and silvered, is believed to have been issued
as a result of that order.</p>

<p class="p2"> The 1821 regulations stated that cockade eagles should measure 1-1/2
inches between wing tips. In 1832 this wingspread was increased to 2-1/2
inches. Thus, specimens of a relatively uniform pattern and measuring
approximately 1-1/2 inches in wingspread will be considered as of the
Regular Army, 1821-1832. Similarly, those of a relatively uniform
pattern and measuring approximately 2-1/2 inches in wingspread are dated
1832-1851.</p>

<p class="p2"> Despite the fact that it was found attached to a shako of distinct
Militia origin, the cap plate shown in figure 36 is believed to be that
prescribed for the cadets of the Military Academy in the 1821 uniform
regulations and described as "yellow plate, diamond shape." The letters
"<span class="smcap">U S M A</span>" in the angles of the diamond, the word "<span class="smcap">CADET</span>" at the top of
the oval, what appears to be the designation "<span class="smcap">W POINT</span>" at the left top
of the map, and the tools of instruction (so similar to those
embellishing the cadet diploma, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page25" name="page25"></a>(p. 25)</span> although totally different in
rendering), make it difficult to assign this plate to any source other
than the Academy. It is possible, of course, that this was a
manufacturer's sample which was never actually adopted for wear at West
Point. The apparent maker's name, "<span class="smcap">CASAD</span>," at the bottom of the oval,
does not appear in the city directories of any of the larger
manufacturing centers of the period.</p>

<p>Despite the facts that there was no change in cap insignia authorized in
the 1832 uniform regulations and that this specimen is similar in most
respects to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page26" name="page26"></a>(p. 26)</span> the 1821 eagle, its refinement of design and
manufacture indicates that it possibly belongs to the period of the
1830's and 1840's. It is struck in thin brass and has three plain wire
fasteners soldered to the reverse.</p>


<h4>CAP INSIGNIA, 1832(?)</h4>

<p class="center"><i>USNM 60366-M (S-K 122). Not illustrated.</i></p>

<p>Although similar to the preceding plate, this specimen measures 3-1/4 by
2-1/4 inches, is struck from a different die, and has a much wider
breast shield. Of somewhat heavier brass than most such similar eagles
and exhibiting a well-developed patina, it may have been an officer's
device.</p>


<h4>CAP PLATE, DRAGOONS, 1833</h4>

<p>When the dragoons returned to the Army in 1833, their cap device was
described as "a gilt star, silver eagle ... the star to be worn in
front."<a id="footnotetag74" name="footnotetag74"></a><a href="#footnote74" title="Go to footnote 74"><span class="smaller">[74]</span></a> An 8-pointed, sunburst-type star, this plate is struck in
brass and has a superimposed eagle that is struck in brass and silvered.
The eagle is basically the Napoleonic type adopted by the British after
the Battle of Waterloo and altered by omitting the lightning in the
talons and adding a wreath to the breast. Plain wire fasteners are
soldered to the back.</p>

<p class="p2"> In 1834, possibly as a result of the newly organized dragoons
receiving distinctive branch insignia, the infantry and artillery once
again were authorized devices on the dress cap designating their
particular arm. The gilt eagle was retained. Below the eagle was an open
horn with cords and tassels in silver for infantry, and cross cannons in
"gilt" for artillery. The number of the regiment was added over the
cannon or within the curve of the horn. These devices remained in use

<p>This eagle is similar to the 1821 pattern, although somewhat more
compact in design. It is struck in brass, has wings upraised, head to
the right, shield on breast, olive branch in right talon, and three
arrows in left talon. The open horn, struck in brass and silvered, is
suspended, with bell to the right, by four twisted cords tied in a
3-leaf-clover knot; the tassels on the four cord-ends hang below.</p>

<p>Although uniform regulations for the period of the 1830's and 1840's
make no mention of a distinctive device for the dragoon forage cap,
photographs in the National Archives show that officers' caps, at least,
carried a 6-pointed star, apparently gold-embroidered.<a id="footnotetag75" name="footnotetag75"></a><a href="#footnote75" title="Go to footnote 75"><span class="smaller">[75]</span></a> This specimen

<p>In 1839 the cadets at the Military Academy discarded the bell-crowned
caps they had worn since 1821 and wore a cylindrical black shako similar
to that worn by the Regular artillery and infantry. The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page28" name="page28"></a>(p. 28)</span>
artillery gilt eagle and crossed cannon replaced the diamond-shaped
plate on the front. In 1842-1843 the crossed cannon were replaced by the
engineer castle as more in keeping with the original mission of the
Academy and the general orientation of its curriculum.</p>

<p>Shortly after the beginning of hostilities with Mexico in 1846, the
Congress authorized the enlistment of a company of "engineer soldiers"
that was designated the Company of Sappers, Miners, and Pontoniers.
These were the first enlisted men authorized the Corps of Engineers
since the period of the War of 1812. The headgear for these men was
prescribed as "Schako&mdash;same pattern as that of the artillery, bearing a
yellow eagle over a castle like that worn by the Cadets."<a id="footnotetag76" name="footnotetag76"></a><a href="#footnote76" title="Go to footnote 76"><span class="smaller">[76]</span></a></p>

<p>Struck in thin to medium brass, this plate is the familiar turreted
castle of the Corps of Engineers so well known today. It was worn below
the eagle.</p>

<p class="p2"> To complete the branches of the Regular Establishment during the
Mexican War period, the Regiment of Voltigeurs and Foot Riflemen must be
mentioned, although they were apparently without any distinctive branch
insignia.</p>

<p>The regiment was constituted on February 11, 1847, and its uniform<a id="footnotetag77" name="footnotetag77"></a><a href="#footnote77" title="Go to footnote 77"><span class="smaller">[77]</span></a>
was prescribed 9 days later in the War Department's General Order No. 7.
However, the regiment was issued infantry woolen jackets and trousers
and never received what little gray issue clothing was sent to them in
Mexico almost a year later. Uniform trimmings were to be as for the
infantry, with the substitution of the letter "v" where appropriate. So
far as presently known, this substitution affected only the button
pattern&mdash;an appropriate letter "v" on the shield centered on the eagle's
breast.</p>

<p>The 1851 uniform regulations radically changed almost every item of the
Army's dress. Most of the distinctive devices were also altered,
although more in size and composition than general design. Some devices
were completely eliminated. While officers retained insignia of their
arm or branch on their hats, enlisted personnel, with the exception of
those of engineers and ordnance, had only the letter of their company,
their particular arm being designated by the color of collars, cuffs,
bands on hats, pompons, epaulets, chevrons, and the like. A newly
designed sword or waist-belt plate was prescribed for all personnel. All
items of uniform and insignia authorized in 1851 were included in an
illustrated edition of the Regulations for the Uniform and Dress of the
Army of the United States, June 1851, published by William H. Horstmann
and Sons, well-known uniform and insignia dealers in Philadelphia.<a id="footnotetag78" name="footnotetag78"></a><a href="#footnote78" title="Go to footnote 78"><span class="smaller">[78]</span></a></p>

<p>Worn attached to the base of the pompon by all enlisted personnel, this
brass eagle, similar in general design to that worn on the shako in the
1830's, stands with wings upraised, olive branch in right talon, three
arrows in left talon, and a scroll, with national motto, in beak. Above
are stars, clouds, and bursts of sun rays. Officers wore an eagle of
similar design of gold embroidery on cloth.</p>

<p>This specimen, in accord with regulations, is on dark blue cloth and
consists of a gold-embroidered wreath encircling Old English letters
"U.S." in silver bullion. Embroidered insignia of this period were all
made by hand, and they varied considerably in both detail and size.
During the 1861-1865 period the same design was made about half this
size for wear on officers' forage caps, and the device appeared in
variant forms. One example is known where the numeral "15" is
embroidered over the letters "<span class="smcap">U.S.</span>";<a id="footnotetag79" name="footnotetag79"></a><a href="#footnote79" title="Go to footnote 79"><span class="smaller">[79]</span></a> and Miller's <i>Photographic

<p>This specimen adheres almost exactly to the 1851 regulations, but it
lacks the number of the regiment as called for. The number was a
separate insignia embroidered above the cannon. The cannon are of gold
embroidery. The device was also made in gold metal imitation-embroidery
in several variant designs.</p>


<h4>CAP INSIGNIA, OFFICER, INFANTRY, 1851</h4>

<p>On dark blue cloth, this device is the well-known looped horn in gold
embroidery with three cords and tassels. The regimental number "4," in
silver bullion, lies within the loop of the horn. This insignia is also
common in metal imitation-embroidery.</p>

<p>Struck in brass, this device was worn on the caps and coat collars of
ordnance enlisted personnel. Although the shell and flame insignia
appears in a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page30" name="page30"></a>(p. 30)</span> number of variations of design, this specimen
conforms exactly to the regulations of 1851 as published by Horstmann.</p>

<p>The 1851 uniform regulations called for a "castle of yellow metal one

<p>Comprising crossed sabers of gold, with edges upward, this insignia is
similar to the well-known device worn by the Regular cavalry as late as
1953.</p>

<p class="p2"> In 1846 the Regiment of Mounted Riflemen was organized to consolidate
the northern route to the Pacific by establishing and manning a series
of posts along the Oregon Trail.<a id="footnotetag80" name="footnotetag80"></a><a href="#footnote80" title="Go to footnote 80"><span class="smaller">[80]</span></a> The outbreak of the War with Mexico
postponed this mission and the unit was diverted to the theater of
operations. Shortly after the regiment was constituted it was authorized
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page31" name="page31"></a>(p. 31)</span> to wear a forage cap device prescribed as "a gold embroidered
spread eagle, with the letter R in silver, on the shield."<a id="footnotetag81" name="footnotetag81"></a><a href="#footnote81" title="Go to footnote 81"><span class="smaller">[81]</span></a> No
surviving specimen of this insignia is known, and there seems some doubt

<p>In 1850 the regiment was given a "trumpet" hat device. Officers were to
wear "a trumpet, perpendicular, embroidered in gold, with the number of
the regiment, in silver, within the bend."<a id="footnotetag83" name="footnotetag83"></a><a href="#footnote83" title="Go to footnote 83"><span class="smaller">[83]</span></a> This trumpet is also
known in metal imitation-embroidery. The prescribed regimental number,
which is illustrated in the Horstmann publication of the regulations
(pl. 15), is not included on the device, probably because there was but
one such unit in the Regular Establishment.</p>


<h4>CAP INSIGNIA, ENLISTED, REGIMENT OF MOUNTED RIFLEMEN, 1850</h4>

<p class="center"><i>USNM 62053-M (SK-1806). Figure 52.</i></p>

<p>The same general order that gave rifle officers a gold-embroidered
trumpet prescribed for enlisted men a similar device to be of "yellow
metal." This insignia lasted but one year for the men in the ranks,
being unmentioned in the 1851 regulations.</p>


<h3>Shoulder-Belt and Waist-Belt Plates</h3>

<p>Oval shoulder-belt plates were worn by American officers during the War
of the Revolution, but no extant specimens are known. Highly ornamented
or engraved officers' plates for the period after 1790 are in several
collections (fig. <a href="#img055">53</a>) and others are illustrated in contemporary
portraits (fig. <a href="#img056">54</a>). Just what year shoulder-belt plates were issued to
enlisted personnel is unknown, but their use appears to have been well
established by 1812. The uniform regulations for that year specified
swords for sergeants of infantry to be "worn with a white cross belt
3-1/2 inches wide," but nothing was said about a device on the belt.<a id="footnotetag84" name="footnotetag84"></a><a href="#footnote84" title="Go to footnote 84"><span class="smaller">[84]</span></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page32" name="page32"></a>(p. 32)</span>

</div>

<p>Normally, brass or "yellow metal" plates were authorized for the
artillery and silvered or "white metal" for the infantry and dragoons,
as consonant with the rest of their trimmings. In actuality, however,
white-metal shoulder-belt plates do not seem to have been issued to the
infantry prior to 1814, and brass ones were still being issued in
1815.<a id="footnotetag85" name="footnotetag85"></a><a href="#footnote85" title="Go to footnote 85"><span class="smaller">[85]</span></a> Most of these plates were plain oval, although a few are known
that were struck with devices similar to those on cap plates; and at
least one rectangular cap plate, fitted with the two studs and hook on
the reverse normal to shoulder-belt plates, has been found. It seems
probable that these were officers' plates. Oval brass plates have been
found that are identical in size and construction to the plain ones but
with the letters "<span class="smcap">U.S.</span>" embossed on them; however, these are difficult
to date.</p>

<a id="img056" name="img056"></a>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure 54.</span>&mdash;Portrait in collection of The Filson Club,

</div>

<p>It is extremely doubtful that waist-belt plates were issued to enlisted
personnel of foot units during this period. In 1808 enlisted dragoons
were authorized a waist-belt plate of tinned brass and, as far as known,
perfectly plain.<a id="footnotetag86" name="footnotetag86"></a><a href="#footnote86" title="Go to footnote 86"><span class="smaller">[86]</span></a></p>

<p>The 1812 regulations prescribed for the light dragoons a "buff leather
waist belt, white plate in front with eagle in relief," and there is the
possibility that the light artillery had such. In actuality, there was
no call for a waist belt where a shoulder belt was authorized. Neither
civilian trousers nor the few surviving military "pantaloons" of the
period are fitted with belt loops, trousers being held up either by
suspenders or by being buttoned directly to the shirt or waistcoat. No
example of the dragoon plate has been found. However, a rather
tantalizing possibility exists&mdash;a fragment of a pewter belt plate (fig.
<a href="#img057">55</a>) was excavated at Sackets Harbor, New York, where the light dragoons
are known to have served. The 1816 regulations specified for
artillerymen "waist belts of white leather two inches wide, yellow oval
plate of the same width." It is not made clear, however, whether this
belt and plate was for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page33" name="page33"></a>(p. 33)</span> officers only or for all ranks. The
unusually striking oval specimen (fig. <a href="#img058">56</a>) may be this plate, but its
ornateness indicates that this particular design was for officers only.</p>

<p>This plate was worn by Peter Gansevoort sometime during his military
career, probably after 1790. Gansevoort, between 1775 and his death in
1812, was successively major, lieutenant colonel, colonel, and brigadier
general of New York State Militia and brigadier general U.S. Army
(1809-1812). Although distinctly Militia in design, the specimen is
included here as an example of the wide variety of such devices worn by
officers of the 1800-1821 period.</p>

<p>This plate is octagonal, slightly convex, and has beveled edges. The
design is hand engraved on copper, and the whole is gold plated. Within
an engraved border is the eagle-on-half-globe device of New York State.
Two studs and a hook soldered to the reverse are not believed to be
original.</p>

<p>This rectangular, slightly convex plate of silver on copper has beveled
edges and a small slot in the center for the attachment of an ornament.
The ornament is missing, although it can be surmised that it was an
eagle. The reverse is fitted with two studs and a hook and bears the
hallmark of "W. Pinchin, Philad<sup>a</sup>." William Pinchin is listed in the
Philadelphia directory for 1809 as a silversmith at 326 Sassafras
Street. The 1810 directory lists only "Widow of," but another William
Pinchin (probably the son) appears in the 1820's.</p>

the same as that offered as the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page34" name="page34"></a>(p. 34)</span> 1814-pattern cap plate for the
light artillery, although it is the product of a different and somewhat
more crudely sunk die. The piece is dominated by an eagle with wings
upraised, a shield on its breast, three arrows in its right talon, and
an olive branch in its left talon. Crossed cannon are in the foreground,
and there is a pile of six cannon balls in the lower right corner. The
whole is superimposed on a trophy of colors and bayoneted muskets. Above
is a 5-pointed "star of stars" made up of 20 5-pointed stars.</p>

<p>The rectangular plate is struck in brass on a die of the same design as
that used in making the 1814 Artillery Corps cap plate, type I (p. 18).
Before the strike was made, a piece of thin sheet iron, slightly
narrower than the finished product, was applied to the reverse of the
brass. After the strike, which shows through clearly on the iron, the
ends of this applied metal were bent inward into tongues for attachments
to the belt, and the remainder of the back was filled with pewter. The
edges of the obverse were then beveled to finish the product. It seems
very probable that plates such as this were produced for sale to
officers.</p>

described above. It was struck in brass from the die of the 1814
Artillery Corps cap plate, type I, again with a thin sheet of iron
applied to the reverse before the strike. There is no pewter filling;
the beveled edges of the piece together with the adhesive effect of the
strike&mdash;which shows through very clearly&mdash;holds on the back. The plate
is fitted with two simple bent-wire fasteners for attachment, indicating
that it was intended for ornamental use only. Like its waist-belt plate
counterpart, this specimen must be considered an officer's device.</p>

with an olive branch in its beak, three arrows in its right talon, and
thunder bolts and lightning in its left talon. Below is a trophy of
stacked muskets, drum, flag, and shield. The plate is silver on copper,
with sheet-iron backing and bent-wire fasteners. As in the case of the
Artillery Corps plate, just preceding, this must be considered an
officer's plate. A similar oval plate bearing the design of the 1812
dragoon cap plate, and of similar construction, is known.</p>

<p class="nofloat">Excavated on the site of Smith's Cantonment at Sackets Harbor, New York,
this plate is interesting in that it differs in both construction and
method of attachment from similar plates of the same period in the
national collections. Rather than being struck in thin brass with a
backing and fasteners applied to the reverse, this specimen is cast in
brass and the edges rather unevenly beveled, with two studs and a narrow
tongue for attachment cast integrally with the plate and with hexagonal
heads forced over the ends of the studs. This means of attachment, which
indicates that the plate was intended to be utilitarian as well as
merely ornamental, is similar to that on British plates of the period
between the Revolution and the War of 1812. The plate could have been
worn by either infantry or artillery, for both were issued brass plates
during this period,<a id="footnotetag87" name="footnotetag87"></a><a href="#footnote87" title="Go to footnote 87"><span class="smaller">[87]</span></a> however, it is more probable that it was worn by
the infantry, since the majority of the artillery in the Sackets Harbor
area were stationed nearby at either Fort Pike or Fort Tomkins.</p>

<p>The plain, oval, slightly convex plate of brass has a raised edge. The
face is lapped over a piece of sheet-iron backing. On the reverse is
soldered an early form of bent-wire fasteners. British shoulder-belt
plates of the Revolutionary period normally had fasteners cast as
integral parts of the plate proper.</p>

<p>The two specimens of this plate in the national collections are
undocumented. Similar in size and construction to the plain oval brass
and silvered plates, it has the raised letters "<span class="smcap">U.S.</span>," three-fourths
inch high in the center. Definitely not later than 1832, it may well
have been issued soon after the end of the War of 1812. It is considered
a Regular Army item since the Militia did not use the designation "<span class="smcap">U.S.</span>"
at this early period. In this latter connection it is interesting to
note that an example of the 1812 Infantry cap plate, type II, with the
letters "<span class="smcap">US</span>" crudely stamped out, is known attached to a cap of distinct
Militia origin.</p>

<p>After the War of 1812, the State of New York presented swords to several
prominent officers of the Army and Navy who had distinguished themselves
in actions within New York or near its borders. One of these swords
(USNM 10294)<a id="footnotetag88" name="footnotetag88"></a><a href="#footnote88" title="Go to footnote 88"><span class="smaller">[88]</span></a> and an unusually fine gold embroidered belt (USNM
33097) with this gold belt buckle were presented to Maj. Gen. Jacob
Brown.</p>

<p>Chased in very fine gold, the buckle is considered by experts in the
goldsmithing and silversmithing fields to be one of the outstanding
pieces of American craftsmanship of its kind.<a id="footnotetag89" name="footnotetag89"></a><a href="#footnote89" title="Go to footnote 89"><span class="smaller">[89]</span></a> The central motif is
the New York State eagle-on-half-globe device on a wreath of the colors.
The head of the eagle is very similar to that on the cap plates of the
1807 Marine Corps, 1812 infantry, and 1814 Artillery Corps. The border
is of a rose pattern distinctly American in feeling, and in each corner
within the border are <span class="pagenum"><a id="page38" name="page38"></a>(p. 38)</span> acanthus leaves in unusually delicate
Viennese baroque design.</p>

<p>The maker of this buckle is unknown, but since it is reasonably certain
that the hilt of the sword was designed by Moritz Furst (see p. <a href="#page12">12</a>), it
is possible that the design of the buckle is his also, especially in
view of the Viennese touch in the acanthus leaves, his training at the
mint in Vienna, and the probability that he designed the 1812 infantry
cap plate.</p>

<p class="p2"> Although the 1821 regulations were very specific about the prohibition
of nonregulation items of uniform and equipment, they were somewhat
vague regarding specifications. General staff and engineer officers were
to wear black belts with a "yellow plate," artillery "yellow oval plates
... with an eagle in the center," and infantry the same but "white"
instead of yellow.<a id="footnotetag90" name="footnotetag90"></a><a href="#footnote90" title="Go to footnote 90"><span class="smaller">[90]</span></a> No oval plates meeting these vague descriptions
are known, but the specimens described below may well have been those
actually approved by the Ordnance Department, and thus, worn.</p>

<p>This plate, struck in copper and silvered, is round with an outer ring.
It is attached to a white buff belt. The plate proper contains an eagle
with wings outspread, shield on breast, olive branch in right talon, and
three arrows in left talon. The whole is within a ring of 24 5-pointed
stars. The outer ring is decorated as a wreath, and the narrow
rectangular belt attachments are embossed with a floral pattern. The 24
stars place this specimen between 1822 and 1836. Similar buckles are
known in yellow metal for either staff or artillery and containing 24,
26, and 28 stars, indicating that they probably were worn until the
rectangular eagle-wreath plate was prescribed in 1851.</p>

<p>This specimen is offered as another possibility for the 1821 regulation
plate. It is identical in size and similar in design to the preceding
plate. The plate proper contains an eagle with wings spread, a breast
shield containing the letter "<span class="smcap">I</span>," an olive branch in right talon, and
three arrows in left talon. There is no outer ring of stars. The outer
ring of the buckle is decorated with a wreath, but the rectangular belt
attachments are plain. The 1821 regulations called for eagle buttons of
"yellow" and "white" metal with the letters "<span class="smcap">A</span>" and "<span class="smcap">I</span>" (for artillery
and infantry) on the eagle's shield, and the belt plate may have been
designed to conform. There is also the possibility that this plate, as
well as the one described below, was designed to conform to the 1835
regulations which prescribed a waist belt with a "round" clasp.<a id="footnotetag91" name="footnotetag91"></a><a href="#footnote91" title="Go to footnote 91"><span class="smaller">[91]</span></a></p>

<p>Nearly identical to the infantry officer's plate above, this buckle, in
brass, has the artillery "<span class="smcap">A</span>" on the eagle's breast shield.</p>

<p class="p2"> Although the regulations for this period do not mention shoulder-belt
plates for enlisted men (officers had none as they wore their swords on
their waist belts), it can be assumed that they were worn. The two
specimens described below must be dated later than 1812-1821 because of
the belt attachments. The earlier specimens had rudimentary bent-wire
fasteners, but these, more refined, have two round studs and a hook
soldered to the plate proper.</p>

<p class="p2"> The 1832 uniform regulations brought some well-defined changes.
General and staff officers were to wear gilt waist-belt plates "having
the letters <span class="smcap">U S</span> and a sprig of laurel on each side in silver," and the
bottom of the skirts of officers' coats were to bear distinctive
devices&mdash;a gold-embroidered star for general officers and officers of
the general staff, a shell and flame in gold embroidery for artillery
officers, and silver-embroidered bugles for infantry officers.</p>

<p>The plate and the belt to which it is attached formerly belonged to
Capt. Charles O. Collins, an 1824 graduate of the Military Academy. The
belt is of patent leather, as specified for undress wear, and is 1-1/2
inches wide. The plate is cast in brass and has raised edges. Rather
than having "a sprig of laurel on each side," it has a wreath of laurel
enclosing the letters "<span class="smcap">U S</span>," in Old English, in silvered metal <span class="pagenum"><a id="page40" name="page40"></a>(p. 40)</span>
affixed to the front. It is attached on the right side by a rectangular
belt attachment with a flat hook on the left rear.</p>

<p class="p2"> The 1832 regulations specified for engineer officers a waist-belt
plate to be "gilt, elliptical, two inches in the shortest diameter,
bearing the device of the button." Such a plate (fig. <a href="#img075">73</a>) is in the
collections of the Valley Forge Chapel Museum. It is entirely possible
that this plate is even earlier than 1832, for the 1821 and 1825
regulations state that the engineer buttons were to contain "the device
and motto heretofore established."</p>

<p>In the collections of the West Point Museum is a button, carrying the
"Essayons" device, that was excavated in the area behind the "Long
Barracks," which burned in 1825. Another such button excavated at
Sackets Harbor on the site of an 1812-1815 barracks bears a maker's name
(Wishart) of the 1812-1816 period.</p>

<p>This buckle is similar to the one (shown in fig. <a href="#img075">73</a>) that belonged to
Capt. Charles O. Collins, but it is different in that the letters "<span class="smcap">U.S.</span>"
are enclosed not by a laurel wreath but by a sprig of laurel on the
right side and a sprig of palm on the left. The 1841 uniform regulations
specified such a belt plate for officers of the Corps of Engineers, but
with a "turreted castle, raised in silver" rather than the letters
"<span class="smcap">U.S.</span>" This places the probable date of manufacture of this specimen in
the 1840's.</p>

<p>This skirt ornament, on buff cloth, is from a coat worn by Capt. Thomas
Swords when he was assistant quartermaster general in 1838. The design
consists of three 6-pointed stars of gold bullion cord: a line <span class="pagenum"><a id="page41" name="page41"></a>(p. 41)</span>
star of twisted cord superimposed upon a larger star of closely stitched
cord that in turn is superimposed upon a still larger star of sunburst
type.</p>

<p>This specimen, on red cloth, is on a coat worn by William Tecumseh
Sherman when he was a lieutenant in the 3d Artillery. The bomb is made
of whorls of gold bullion cord, while the flames are composed of curving
lines of twisted bullion. The lowest flame on either side terminates in
arrow heads.</p>

<p>There are a number of gold-embroidered shell and flame devices in the
national collections, all varying considerably in size and composition.
Some are skirt ornaments for artillery officers, both Regular Army and
Militia, while some are cap ornaments for ordnance officers. Indeed, two
coats formerly belonging to Maj. Levi Twiggs, U.S. Marine Corps, carry
the same device.</p>

<p>The silver coat-skirt horn ornaments of infantry officers varied almost
as much as the shell and flame devices, generally in relation to the
affluence of the individual concerned. Unlike such ornaments of the
other services, the horns were paired in rights and lefts on the coat.</p>

<p>This specimen, of silver bullion cord, is on a coat that once belonged
to Lt. William Williams Mather, an 1828 graduate of the Military Academy
who left the service in 1836. The horn is looped, and it is suspended by
twisted bullion from a simple 3-leaf-clover knot. The whole is backed on
blue cloth.</p>

<p>This rather elaborate specimen is on a coat worn by John Porter Hatch
when he was a lieutenant of infantry in 1845. The body of the
horn&mdash;which is merely curved rather than looped&mdash;is made of silver lam
encircled by three ornamented bands of bullion. The mouthpiece and bell
are of bullion. The whole is suspended by a rather ornate 3-leaf-clover
knot of bands of edged bullion and is backed on blue cloth.</p>

<p>The uniform regulations for the period 1832-1846 carry no mention of
coat-skirt ornaments for the Corps of Topographical Engineers, rather
only prescribing the "slashed skirt flaps to be embroidered in gold,
with oak leaves and acorns" like the collar and cuffs. There is in the
national collections, however, a uniform for the Corps that corresponds
with 1839 regulations in every way except that the coat skirts carry
this ornament&mdash;a shield within a wreath of oak leaves&mdash;of gold
embroidery. The device appears to be of the same vintage as the other
embroidery on the coat.</p>

<p class="p2"> Although the 1832 uniform regulations make no mention of swords for
noncommissioned officers, in 1833 the Ames Manufacturing Company of
Chicopee, Massachusetts, began the manufacture of a new sword for the
Regular artillery. Based on a European pattern, this weapon was the
popular conception of the short Roman stabbing sword, or <i>gladius</i>. In
1834 this weapon was also authorized for infantry noncommissioned
officers.<a id="footnotetag92" name="footnotetag92"></a><a href="#footnote92" title="Go to footnote 92"><span class="smaller">[92]</span></a></p>

<p>This is the belt-plate assembly designed for carrying the short "Roman
pattern" NCO sword. The plate is of two round pieces joined by an
S-hook that is open on one end for unbuckling. Each round
piece has a flat loop for attachment to the white buff belt. The
right-hand round piece has an eagle with head to the left, wings
drooping, three arrows in the right talon, and an olive branch in the
left talon. The left-hand piece has crossed cannons and the letters
"<span class="smcap">U.S.</span>" The whole is cast in rough bronze.</p>

<p>Assemblies of this type were popularly known as "Dingee" belts, because
one of the primary contractors for them was Robert Dingee of New York
City. The eagle on this plate is very similar to the one on Dingee's
contract rifle flasks of 1832.<a id="footnotetag93" name="footnotetag93"></a><a href="#footnote93" title="Go to footnote 93"><span class="smaller">[93]</span></a></p>

<p>The 1835 uniform regulations replaced the rather impractical S-hook
NCO belt plate with a "round clasp" on which the branch
designation was replaced with the raised letters "<span class="smcap">U S.</span>" Similar in
over-all design to the 1821 officers' plate, round with outer ring,
these plates were rough cast in brass and had a stippled surface.</p>

<p>The 1839 uniform regulations specified a shoulder belt (rather than a
waist belt) for carrying the sword, with a "breast plate according to
the pattern to be furnished by the Ordnance Department." This plate,
which was worn by Capt. Erastus Capron, 1st Artillery, an 1833 graduate
of the Military Academy, is believed to be that specified.<a id="footnotetag95" name="footnotetag95"></a><a href="#footnote95" title="Go to footnote 95"><span class="smaller">[95]</span></a> The
specimen is rectangular with beveled edges, cast in brass, and has
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page45" name="page45"></a>(p. 45)</span> the lines of a modified sunburst radiating outward. In the
center, within a wreath of laurel, are the letters "<span class="smcap">U S</span>" in Old English.
Both the wreath and letters are of silvered copper and are applied. The
plate is attached by three broad hooks rather than two studs and a hook.</p>

<p>The 1839 uniform regulations prescribed this plate for the Corps of
Topographical Engineers. The oval inner plate, which contains the
prescribed eagle, shield, and the letters "<span class="smcap">U S</span>" in Old English, is
struck in medium weight copper and gilded. This inner plate is soldered
to a cast-bronze and gilded tongue which in turn is brazed to a
cast-bronze belt attachment. The oval outer ring, bearing the prescribed
"<span class="smcap">CORPS OF TOPOGRAPHICAL ENGINEERS</span>" in Roman capitals, is cast in brass
and gilded. To the inner edge of this outer ring are brazed two curved
seats for the inner oval. The whole is brazed to the belt attachment,
also cast in brass and gilded.</p>

<p class="p2"> In view of the large and somewhat elaborate cap plates as well as
shoulder-belt plates adopted by both the Regulars and Militia early in
the 19th century, it is somewhat surprising that apparently neither
component had ornamentation on its cartridge boxes until the Ordnance
Regulations of 1834 prescribed a very ornate design embossed on the
leather flap.<a id="footnotetag96" name="footnotetag96"></a><a href="#footnote96" title="Go to footnote 96"><span class="smaller">[96]</span></a> Certainly there was precedent for such, for both the
British and German mercenary troops of the Revolution and the British
and Canadian troops of the War of 1812 wore metal ornaments on their
cartridge boxes. At least partial explanation for this omission may lie
in one of Callender Irvine's reasons for rejecting brass cartridge boxes
in favor of leather ones: "The leather ... affords no mark for the enemy
to sight at. The brass ... would afford a central object, as regards the
body of the Soldier, and one which would be seen at a great distance to
fire at."<a id="footnotetag97" name="footnotetag97"></a><a href="#footnote97" title="Go to footnote 97"><span class="smaller">[97]</span></a> Why Irvine did not object equally to the large white and
yellow metal cap and shoulder-belt plates as targets is unknown. In any
case&mdash;with a possible few Militia exceptions such as a Militia cartridge
box with a plate bearing the likeness of Washington in silver, both
about 1835&mdash;the 1839 model oval plates were the first to be worn.</p>

<p>The ordnance regulations of 1839 and the ordnance manual of 1841 brought
in two distinctly new types of plates, the familiar brass oval
waist-belt and cartridge-box plates with the letters "<span class="smcap">U. S.</span>" and the
round shoulder-belt plate with the eagle. The oval plates fall into two
general sizes, 3.5 inches by 2.2 inches (for plates on the infantry's
cartridge box and the cavalry's waist belts)<a id="footnotetag98" name="footnotetag98"></a><a href="#footnote98" title="Go to footnote 98"><span class="smaller">[98]</span></a> and 2.8 inches by 1.6
inches (for plates on the infantry's waist belts and the cavalry's
carbine cartridge boxes and pistol cartridge boxes). The use of each
plate is determined by the type of fastener. These plates were struck in
thin brass and the backs generally leaded, although some were used
without such backing, probably to save both weight and material.
Cartridge boxes were also embossed with the outline of this oval plate
in lieu of the plate itself. It is interesting to note that the larger
plates with lead backs weighed about 5-1/2 ounces and the smaller ones
just over 2 ounces.</p>

<p>The reverse side of this plate is fitted with the rather rudimentary
wire fasteners similar to those on shoulder-belt plates of the 1812-1821
period. In other respects the specimen is identical to the preceding
ones of 1839.</p>

<p class="p2"> The 1839 regulations specified a bayonet-belt plate "round, brass,
with eagle." The 1841 ordnance manual was more exact, specifying the
plate to be "brass, circular, 2.5 in. diameter, with an Eagle," and then
stating: "The bayonet belt is about to be discontinued ..." Although not
so authorized at the time, this plate, so familiar during the Civil War
period, was switched over to the shoulder belt supporting the cartridge
box. Such plates were manufactured in great quantities and in many
variations of the original design by a dozen or more contractors during
the period 1861-1865.</p>

<p>This circular plate, with raised rim, is dominated by an eagle of
refined design that is very similar to the eagles appearing on the War
of 1812 plates. The eagle has its wings drooped, head to the left, three
arrows in the right talon, and an olive branch in the left talon. This
specimen can be dated with the earliest cartridge-box plates because of
its backing and the type of fasteners. Whereas the backs of the later
models were lead-filled, this plate was struck in thin brass over tin
and the edges of the obverse crimped to retain the backing. The
fasteners are of the bent-wire type typical of the 1812-1832 period and
are not the "2 eyes of iron wire" called for in the ordnance manual of
1850. None of the later examples of this design evidence any of the
refinement of the original. At least eight variations are represented in
the national collections.</p>

<p class="nofloat">The 1851 regulations prescribed this plate for all officers and enlisted
men. It was specified to be "gilt, rectangular, two inches wide, with a
raised bright rim; a silver wreath of laurel encircling the 'Arms of the
United States'; eagle, scroll, edge of cloud and rays bright. The motto,
'E Pluribus Unum,' in silver letters upon the scroll; stars also of
silver; according to pattern."<a id="footnotetag99" name="footnotetag99"></a><a href="#footnote99" title="Go to footnote 99"><span class="smaller">[99]</span></a></p>

<p>This plate has had a longer history than any other similar Army device.
It was authorized for all personnel until 1881 when it was dropped as an
item of enlisted equipment. It was retained for officers, first for
general wear, then for dress only. It was worn with officers' dress blue
uniforms until 1941, but was not revived when blues reappeared after
World War II. A plate of the same general size and pattern, although
gilt in its entirety, was prescribed for senior NCO's of the Marine
Corps until about 1950 or 1951.</p>

<p>The buckle appears in many variations of design, at least 12 being
represented in the national collections. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page48" name="page48"></a>(p. 48)</span> Many of these
variations are the result of the plate being produced in great numbers
by many different contractors during the Civil War. The original design
itself is interesting. The 1851 description called for an "edge of cloud
and rays" and the official, full size drawing in <i>Regulations for the
Uniform and Dress of the Army</i> includes the "edge of cloud" and pictures
the eagle with its head to the heraldic left. At least 50 of these
plates were examined by the authors, but only this specimen had the
"edge of cloud," silver letters and stars, and the eagle with its head
to the left. In most specimens the plate proper is bronze, in one piece,
and with the wreath silvered or left plain; in a few specimens the
wreath is in white metal and has been applied after casting. This
particular specimen is of an early issue. It is cast in heavy brass,
with the wreath applied, and has the narrow brass tongue for attachment
on the reverse (fig. <a href="#img097">95</a>), typical of the early types.</p>

<p>This is a sample struck from a die which apparently was not approved for
the 1851 pattern plate. The eagle has wings upraised (2 inches tip to
tip), head to right, shield on breast, scroll with "E Pluribus Unum" in
beak, three arrows in right talon, and an olive branch in left talon.
Stars are intermixed with "edge of cloud" and rays.</p>

<p>The specimen leads to the interesting speculation as to the weight given
to correct heraldic usage at <span class="pagenum"><a id="page49" name="page49"></a>(p. 49)</span> this period. The significance of
the clouds, or lack of them, is unknown, but it should be noted that in
all but the earliest specimens the eagle's head is turned to the right,
or the side of honor, and the olive branch is placed in the right talon,
indicating peaceful national motives as opposed to the three arrows,
signs of belligerency, in the left talon. In this respect, it is
interesting to note that until 1945 the eagle on the President's seal
and flag carried its head turned to the heraldic left.</p>

<p>This silver ornament is one of the most unusual pieces of military
insignia in the national collections. Obviously military, it is just as
obviously of Militia origin. Although hardly artistic in design, it has
a rather attractive simplicity and has been made with considerable care.
The eagle is of the "frogleg" design that first appeared on buttons of
the post-Revolutionary Army and, later on, of the Legion. In its right
talon the eagle is grasping what appear to be rather stylized
thunderbolts, and in its left, arrows. The arc above the eagle's head is
comprised of sunrays, an edge of clouds, and 16 6-pointed stars. If the
number of stars is of significance, the piece would date prior to
November 1802 when the 17th state, Ohio, was admitted to the union. The
"frog-legged" aspect of the design would tend to confirm such dating,
and the thunderbolts in the right talon, symbolic of a belligerent
attitude, could be attributed to the national temper during the "quasi
war" with France, 1798-1800. The "ID," in delicate floriated script on
the eagle's breast, quite out of consonance with the design and
execution of the piece proper and obviously the work of a talented
engraver, is interpreted as "Independent Dragoons." Too small for a hat
frontpiece, it was probably worn as a side ornament on a dragoon helmet.</p>

<p>This grenadier-type plate, which is untrimmed and thus may be a die
sample, is a rare example of the use of coiled snakes as a military
device after 1800. A familiar motif of the Revolution, coiled snakes
were not revived as a popular military symbol during the War of 1812.
This specimen is struck in brass and is believed to have been made for a
specific independent Militia organization, designation unknown, for wear
prior to 1812.</p>

<p>The eagle-on-clouds design, which first appeared on coins on the 1795
silver dollar, was popular on insignia during the period 1812-1821. The
heraldic significance of the clouds, if any, is unknown. Somewhat larger
than most cockade devices, this eagle is <span class="pagenum"><a id="page53" name="page53"></a>(p. 53)</span> struck in brass and
silvered and has two simple wire fasteners soldered to the reverse. A
very similar badge is shown by Rembrandt Peale in an oil portrait of
Col. Joseph O. Bogart of the 3d Flying Artillery.<a id="footnotetag102" name="footnotetag102"></a><a href="#footnote102" title="Go to footnote 102"><span class="smaller">[102]</span></a></p>

<p>This eagle, of the general design first seen on the 1807 half-dollar, is
very similar to the one on buttons ascribed to staff officers,
1814-1821.<a id="footnotetag103" name="footnotetag103"></a><a href="#footnote103" title="Go to footnote 103"><span class="smaller">[103]</span></a> The eagle, struck in brass, has wings upraised and the
familiar hooked beak; it stands on a wreath of the colors. The wire
fasteners on the reverse are of a somewhat unusual type and may not be
contemporary.</p>

<p class="p2"> Die work for cap, shoulder-belt, and waist-belt plates was expensive,
and many Militia organizations found it expedient to purchase devices
"ready made" from existing dies. By varying the trimming and adding
borders of various designs, the same dies could be used to strike all
three types of plates. Such badges are called "common" plates.</p>

<p>The common plates that follow were very popular during the period
1812-1835 and, although relatively rare today, were made in considerable
quantity and in many die variations for the Militia in every part of the
country. They are known in brass, copper, and silver-on-copper. It is
possible that specimens such as these may have been worn by some
officers of the Regular Establishment between 1814 and 1821.</p>

<p>This is a typical example of the common plates of the 1814-1835 period.
The piece is struck in brass and has an edged and stippled border. The
design is dominated by an eagle with wings outspread, head to left,
arrows in right talon, olive branch in left talon, and with the national
motto on a ribbon overhead. The whole is superimposed on a trophy of
arms and colors with an arc of 13 6-pointed stars above. A plume socket,
apparently original, is soldered to the reverse, as are two looped-wire
fasteners. The fasteners are of a later period.</p>

<p>Struck in copper and silvered, this piece is a die variant of the

<p>A die variant of the preceding plate, this device has an unusually wide

to strike matching waist-belt plates. Examples of waist-belt plates
struck from dies of this particular design are known. Struck in copper,
there is a plume socket soldered to the reverse along with two

<p>This is a die variant of the three plates immediately preceding.
However, the center device lacks the fineness of detail of the others, a
fact that suggests that several makers working with different die
sinkers produced this basic pattern. The plate is struck in copper, and
originally it had a plume socket attached to the reverse. The present
looped-wire fasteners are not original.</p>

<p>This plate, which is of brass, is of a less common design than its
predecessors. However, since there is another such plate, but of
silver-on-copper, in the national collections, it can be surmised that
pieces of this same pattern were made for use by several different
units.</p>

<p>A floral-bordered shield is topped by an out-sized sunburst with 13
stars, clouds, and the motto "Unity <span class="pagenum"><a id="page55" name="page55"></a>(p. 55)</span> is Strength." In the center
of the shield is the eagle, with wings widely outspread and with
lightning bolts in the right talon and an olive branch in the left
talon. The lightning bolt device, obvious sign of belligerency, first
appeared about 1800 and is not seen in plates designed after 1821. The
motto and the date 1776 are far more typical of Militia than Regular
Army usage.</p>

<p class="p2"> In 1821 the Regular Army discarded all its large cap plates and
adopted the bell-crown leather cap. Militia organizations lost no time
in adopting a similar cap and, conversely, placing on it&mdash;and on the
tall beaver which followed in the 1830's&mdash;the largest plates it could
accommodate, using variations of discarded Regular Army patterns as well
as original designs.</p>

<p>From 1821 until well into the 1840's large cap plates were mass-produced
by manufacturers in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and perhaps other
cities of the New England metal manufacturing area. The few early
platemakers, such as Crumpton and Armitage of Philadelphia and Peasley
of Boston, were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page56" name="page56"></a>(p. 56)</span> joined by a number of others. Prominent among
these were Charles John Joullain, who made plates in New York during the
1820's, and William Pinchin of Philadelphia. Joullain is first listed in
New York directories, in 1817, as a "gilder," and so continues through
1828. Sometimes his given name is listed as Charles, sometimes as James,
and finally as Charles James. From 1820 to 1828 his address is the same,
32 Spring Street. There is a William Pinchin (Pinchon) listed in the
Philadelphia directories as a silverplater or silversmith almost
continuously from 1785 through 1863, indicating the possibility of a
family occupation.</p>

<p>It is believed that some of the New England makers of uniform buttons
also manufactured plates. Among such buttonmakers of the 1820's and
1830's were R. and W. Robinson, D. Evans and Co., Leavenworth and Co.,
Benedict and Coe, and others in Connecticut and Massachusetts.
Buttonmakers often stamped their names or easily recognizable hallmarks
on the back of their products.</p>

<p>In most cases it is virtually impossible to ascertain the precise units
for which these different plates were first designed, and the problem is
further complicated because the maker would sell a specific plate design
to several different units. Those designs that incorporate all or part
of a state's seal were originally made for Militia organizations of the
particular state, but in several instances these plates were
sold&mdash;altered or not&mdash;to units in other parts of the country. Militia
organizations that were widely separated geographically purchased cap
plates from distant manufacturers who had perhaps a dozen or more stock
patterns to offer at a cost much lower than that involved in making a
new die from which to strike custom-made ornaments. It made no
difference to the Savannah Greys, in Georgia, that their new cap plates
were the same as those worn by organizations in Pennsylvania and
Massachusetts. Toward the end of this period of large cap plates,
manufacturers came out with two-piece ornaments. After 1833, when the
Regiment of United States Dragoons was authorized its large sunburst
plate with separate eagle ornament in the center, insignia makers
introduced a veritable rash of full sunburst, three-quarter sunburst,
and half-sunburst cap plates with interchangeable centers. And for the
first time small Militia units could afford their own distinctive
devices at little extra cost. Shoulder-belt and waist-belt plates
underwent the same evolution, and by the late 1830's such plates had
become a mixture of either single die stampings or composite plates made
of several parts soldered or otherwise held onto a rectangular or oval
background.</p>

<p>Study of cap plates and other insignia in the Huddy and Duval prints in
<i>U.S. Military Magazine</i> points to the years between 1833 and perhaps
1837 or 1838 as the transition period from single to composite
ornaments, years during which there was also tremendous growth in the
popularity and number of independent Militia units. In contrast to the
1820's when the Militia often waited until the Regulars discarded a
device before adopting it, in 1840 there were no less than five
organizations, mounted and dismounted, wearing the 1833 dragoon plate in
full form while it was still in use by the Regulars. <i>U.S. Military
Magazine</i> illustrates such plates for the Richmond Light Infantry Blues,
the Georgia Hussars, the Macon Volunteers, the Jackson Rifle Corps of
Lancaster, Pa., the Montgomery Light Guard, and the Harrison Guards of
Allentown, Pa. The plate of the Harrison Guards is an example of the
license sometimes practiced by Huddy and Duval in the preparation of
their military prints. The color bearer in this print is depicted
wearing a full sunburst plate, while the description of the uniform
called for "a semi-circular plate or <i>gloria</i>."<a id="footnotetag104" name="footnotetag104"></a><a href="#footnote104" title="Go to footnote 104"><span class="smaller">[104]</span></a></p>

<p>In the following descriptions of plates, the term "stock pattern" is
used because the insignia are known to have been worn by more than one
organization, because their basic designs are so elementary that it
appears obvious that they were made for wide distribution, or because
they are known to have been made both in silver and in gilt metals.</p>

<p>On the raised center of this shield-shaped plate is the eagle-on-cannon
device within an oval floral border; the Federal shield is below. The
whole is superimposed on a trophy of arms and colors with portions of a
modified sunburst appearing on the sides. The plate is struck in brass.
The eagle-on-cannon first appeared on Regular artillery buttons in 1802.
About 1808 it was used as an embossed device on the leather fan cockade,
and in 1814 it became the principal design element of the cap plate for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page57" name="page57"></a>(p. 57)</span> Regulars. This plate is thought to be one of the earliest of
the post-1821 series of Militia cap plates incorporating the discarded
design of the Regular artillery.</p>

<p>This silver-on-copper plate is unique in size, shape, and over-all
design. It is one of the most unusual Militia insignia in the national
collections. The standing eagle of the 1807 mint design with Federal
shield, the panoply of arms and colors, and the rayed background all
suggest that this plate was made not later than the early 1820's. Quite
possibly it is a cap plate of the War of 1812 period, but positive
dating is impossible. Three simple wire fasteners are affixed to the
reverse.</p>

<p>Although the Regular riflemen wore a diamond-shaped plate from 1812 to
1814, this shape does not appear on Militia caps until the mid-1820's.
It was a common form through the 1830's, but since it was always made as
a one-piece die-struck plate it became out-dated in the late 1830's when
the composite plates came into vogue.</p>

<p>This plate, struck in brass and bearing the eagle-on-cannon device, must
be considered a stock pattern available to many organizations. Insignia
struck from the same die could have been easily made into shoulder-belt
plates as well.</p>

</div>

<p>This brass plate is similar in many respects to the regular infantry cap
plate, type I, 1814-1821. It is attached to a bell-crowned shako of
distinctly Militia origin and is cut in the diamond shape popular with
the Militia in the 1820's and 1830's. The design lies within a raised
oval dominated by an eagle similar to ones used on War of 1812 insignia.
Below the eagle is a Federal shield and a trophy of stacked muskets, a
drum surmounted by a dragoon helmet, a gun on a truck carriage, and
colors&mdash;one the National Colors with 16 stars in the canton.</p>

<p>The plume holder attached to the cap above the plate is an unusually
interesting and distinctive device. It is a hemisphere of thin brass
with a round plume socket at the top. The hemisphere has an eagle on a
shield and a superimposed wreath device in silver. The blazonry of the
shield cannot be identified with any particular state or locality.</p>

<p>The familiar hooked-beak eagle dominates the center of this brass,
scalloped-edge plate. The arrows of belligerency, however, are held in
the left talon. Surrounding the eagle is a three-quarter wreath of olive
with the national motto above and the date 1776 below. While there is a
possibility that this plate may fall into the period 1814-1821 because
of its outline shape, it lacks the panoply of arms associated with that
era. It is much more probable that this is one of the earliest plates
made for Militia during the years 1821-1830. Since this plate is also
known in silver-on-copper, it is considered a stock pattern.</p>

<p>This oval, brass-struck plate framed within a large wreath of laurel is
one of the finest in the national collections, comprising as it does a
number of devices of excellent design and considerable detail standing
in high relief. The curving line of 21 stars above the motto, decreasing
in size laterally, is an interesting detail, and the eagle and panoply
of arms is reminiscent of those on the plate ascribed to the Regiment of
Light Artillery, 1814-1821, and on several of the common Militia plates
of the same period. It is <span class="pagenum"><a id="page59" name="page59"></a>(p. 59)</span> assigned to the artillery because of
its "yellow metal" composition. It has simple wire fasteners, applied to
the reverse, and carries no plume socket.</p>

<p>This unusually large, shield-shaped plate, struck in brass, is dominated
by an eagle&mdash;within a smaller shield with raised edge&mdash;standing on a
half globe and wreath of the colors, both of which are superimposed on a
trophy of arms and flags; clouds and sun rays are above. The specimen
represents one of the large cap plate patterns adopted by the Militia
for wear on the bell-crown cap soon after it came into general use in
the early 1820's. While a stock pattern in a sense, its use was most
likely confined to New York State Militia because its principal device,
the eagle-on-half-globe, is taken directly from that state's seal. These
large plates were widely worn until the middle or late 1830's when newer
styles began to replace them. The plume socket affixed to the reverse
appears to be contemporary, but has been resoldered.</p>

<p>This is a variant of the preceding plate and well illustrates how an
insignia-maker could adapt a single die for several products. The
eagle-on-half-globe, with a portion of the trophy of arms and colors,
and the clouds and sunburst above have merely been cut out from the
plate proper for use alone. The plate is struck in brass.</p>

<p>Another specimen, of silver-on-copper, is known, indicating that this
insignia was made for wear by infantry as well as by other branches of
the service; consequently, it may be termed a stock pattern.</p>

<p>Illustrating fine craftsmanship, this elaborate brass cap plate
comprises perhaps the most ornate and intricately detailed design ever
attempted by a military ornament die sinker. The strike itself has been
so well executed that the most minute details are <span class="pagenum"><a id="page60" name="page60"></a>(p. 60)</span> even today
readily discernible, even after very apparent use. Made for New York
Militia, its central theme is the eagle-on-half-globe superimposed on a
trophy of arms and flags.</p>

<p>Many of the facets of detail are of particular interest. Almost every
ray of the aura of sunlight can still be clearly seen; the North Pole is
well marked with a vertical arrow; the Arctic Circle, Tropic of
Capricorn, and the Equator are included on the half-globe, as are the
meridians of longitude and the parallels of latitude; both North America
and South America are shown, and that portion of North America east of
the Mississippi basin is clearly denominated "<span class="smcap">United States.</span>" An unusual
feature of the design is the way the arrows are held in the eagle's left
talon&mdash;some of the arrow heads point inward, some outward. What appears
to have been a contemporary plume socket has been resoldered to the
reverse.</p>

<p>Although this plate is unmarked as to maker, another plate of a similar
design but of silver-on-copper has the maker's mark "<span class="smcap">J. JOULLAIN, MAKER,
N. YORK</span>." Since two distinct but similar designs are known, and the
finished product is found in both brass and silver-on-copper, it seems
probable that this plate was produced by more than one maker, and for
all arms of the service. It is therefore deemed a stock pattern.</p>


<h4>CAP PLATE, RIFLEMEN, C. 1825</h4>

</div>

<p>Almost immediately after the last Regular rifle regiment was disbanded
in 1821, Militia riflemen adopted the large open horn with loops and
tassels that the Regulars had worn from 1817 to 1821. The basic device
was altered slightly by showing an eagle in flight and the horn
suspended much lower on its cords. The illustrated brass plate is one of
four die variants, and more than a dozen similar to it have been
examined. It is significant that all are of brass, for these were made
and worn during the period when the trimmings for infantry were silver
or "white metal."</p>

<p>This plate differs from the others examined in that it has 17 6-pointed
stars along the upper and lower parts of the shield inside the border.
The number of stars cannot be significant in dating for the plate was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page61" name="page61"></a>(p. 61)</span> obviously made long after 1812 when the 18th state, Louisiana,
was admitted to the Union. A plume socket affixed to the reverse appears
to be original.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly made as a stock pattern by several manufacturers, these
plates continued in use for at least 15 years after they first appeared
about 1825. Although <i>U.S. Military Magazine</i> illustrates many large cap
plates for the period 1839-1841, none has a shield outline. This may
indicate a decline in the popularity of the design, but it must be
remembered that Huddy and Duval presented the uniforms of only a small
cross-section of the Militia of the period.</p>


<h4>CAP PLATE, RIFLEMEN, C. 1825</h4>

<p class="center"><i>USNM 60267-M (S-K 26). Figure 117.</i></p>

</div>

<p>This is a second form of Militia riflemen's plates. Struck in brass, it
differs from the preceding primarily in the placement of 17 5-pointed
stars along the upper half of the shield, between the borders. Other
small differences show that the basic die was not that used for the
preceding specimen. The most obvious difference <span class="pagenum"><a id="page62" name="page62"></a>(p. 62)</span> is the legend
"<span class="smcap">E PLURIBUS UNUM</span>" carried on the ribbon behind the knotted cord of the
horn, an element not present in the other.</p>

<p>A third form, not illustrated, substitutes a floral border for the plain
border around the edge of the shield and contains no stars as part of
the design. Still a fourth form, also not illustrated, has the same
center device of eagle and open horn placed in a longer and narrower
shield, with 23 6-pointed stars between the borders.</p>

<p class="p2"> These various combinations of devices give a good clue as to the
method of manufacture of stock patterns, and indicate the use of several
different dies and hand punches. The blank metal was first struck by a
die that formed the plain or floral border and cut the outline of the
plate. Next, a smaller die containing the center device of eagle and
horn was used. Then the stars, and sometimes elements of the floral
border, were added by individual striking with a hand punch. This latter
method is clearly revealed by the comparison of several "identical"
plates in which the stars or elements of the border are irregularly and
differently spaced.</p>


<h4>CAP PLATE, RIFLEMAN PATTERN, C. 1825</h4>

<p>This plate is called "rifleman pattern" because it is silver-on-copper
and is the only known example of this type of insignia made for wear by
infantry, or possibly for Militia riflemen whose trimmings were,
incorrectly, silver.</p>

<p>There are several conjectures about this cut-out device made from a die
of the preceding series of shield plates. It may have been made after
1834, when the open horn with cord and tassels was adopted by the
Regular infantry as a branch device. It is equally possible that it was
submitted to a Militia infantry organization by some maker as a sample
during the 1820's and when selected was silvered to conform with other
trimmings. In either case, it illustrates how a single die could serve
to make many different variations from a basic design.</p>

<p>The very unusual construction of this brass plate for riflemen indicates
that it is possibly one of the earliest of the composite plates. Within
a wreath of crossed laurel boughs is a small center circle with raised
edge to which has been soldered the eagle and horn device struck in
convex form.</p>

<p>The diamond-shaped plate was in vogue with Militia units during the late
1820's and the 1830's. Examples of such plates for the Washington Grays
(Philadelphia) and the Philadelphia Grays are recorded in <i>U.S. Military
Magazine</i>.<a id="footnotetag105" name="footnotetag105"></a><a href="#footnote105" title="Go to footnote 105"><span class="smaller">[105]</span></a> This brass plate, possibly made for a particular unit
from stock dies, is a typical example of the endless variety possible
with the use of a few dies. The blank was struck with a die for the
center device of eagle and horn, but the irregularity of the spacing of
the stars shows that they were added later by hand. Similar plates may
be found with essentially this same device, but placed on small shields
or backgrounds of other shapes.</p>

</div>

<p>The eagle and horn devices were sometimes separated by the manufacturer
to produce this type ornament open with cord and tassels. Struck in
brass, it differs in form and detail from the silver horn adopted by the
Regular infantry in 1834 as a cap plate.</p>

<p>Several Militia units of the late 1830's and 1840's used a horn as an
additional ornament on the rear of the cap, notably the State Fencibles
(Philadelphia) and the National Guard (Philadelphia). On the rear of the
leather cap of the State Fencibles were "two broad rich stripes of
silver lace, starting from the same point at the top and running down,
forming an angle, in the center of which is a bugle ornament...."<a id="footnotetag106" name="footnotetag106"></a><a href="#footnote106" title="Go to footnote 106"><span class="smaller">[106]</span></a>
The cap of the National Guard has been described as being "of blue cloth
... and in the rear a plated bugle ornament."<a id="footnotetag107" name="footnotetag107"></a><a href="#footnote107" title="Go to footnote 107"><span class="smaller">[107]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"> In the following series of rather similar plates, four different dies
are used for the center ornament, perhaps made by as many different die
sinkers. The relatively large number of these plates still in existence
suggests that they were worn very extensively. Those with silver finish
were used by infantry; the gilt or copper ones by artillery and perhaps

<p>The floral-bordered shield outline of this silver-on-copper infantry
plate is known to have been used also with the rifleman's eagle-horn
device in the center. The panoply of arms and flags used as a background
for the center device, which is characterized by the long neck of the
eagle swung far to the right, links it closely to the plate of similar
type worn during the period 1814-1821. Because of its large size, it is
assigned to the post-1821 era of the bell-crown cap, contemporary with
the riflemen's large plates. The 13 5-pointed stars were added with a
hand punch.</p>

<p>This brass plate is a duplicate of the preceding, lacking only the
hand-applied stars. The crispness of detail indicates that it was one of
the very early products of the die.</p>

<p>The second variation of the series is a product of perhaps the best
executed die of the group, with unusually fine detail in the eagle's
wings and with neatly stacked cannon balls at the bottom of the center
device. It includes other excellent detail not found in other dies: an
eagle-head pommel on one sword, a star pattern made of smaller stars in
the cantons of the flags, and crossed cannon, rammer, and worm behind
the Federal shield. It is struck in brass.</p>

<p>A tall, slender, rather graceless eagle with broad wings and erect head
reminiscent of the Napoleonic eagle is the outstanding difference in
this third example of the series. The floral border lacks a finished
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page65" name="page65"></a>(p. 65)</span> look because the plate, which is of brass, was apparently hand
trimmed.</p>

<p>This fourth variation, of silver-on-copper, bears an eagle with very
small legs (somewhat out of proportion), an erect head, a fierce mien,
and a heavy round breast. The design is struck on a shield-plate with
the exact measurements as on one of the riflemen series.</p>

<p>The oldest known plate made expressly for musicians, this
silver-on-copper, floral-bordered shield bears an eagle similar to one
for riflemen of the same period (see fig. <a href="#img118">116</a>). Among the early musical
instruments easily identifiable in the design are the tambor, the
serpent, the French horn, and the rack of bells. Such a plate was
undoubtedly a stock pattern, available in either gilt or silver finish,
and was probably sold well into the 1840's. The reverse is fitted with
what appears to be a contemporary plume socket, although resoldered, and
two simple wire fasteners.</p>

<p>This gilded brass plate, while not as old as the preceding one, is of an
unusual pattern. Made for New York State Militia, it carries the
eagle-on-half-globe device at the top. The central design includes a
French horn, a serpent, and a straight horn, all intertwined about an
open roll of sheet music. It is probably a stock pattern. The reverse is
fitted with three simple bent-wire fasteners.</p>


<h4>CAP PLATE, C. 1830</h4>

<p class="smcap">Figure 129</p>
</div>

<p>The design on this brass plate, reminiscent of that on the regular
infantry cap plate, 1814-1821, was adopted for wear by the Militia after
being discarded by the Regular Establishment. The ornate floral border
and diamond shape place it in the late 1820's and the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page66" name="page66"></a>(p. 66)</span> 1830's,
although the lightning in the eagle's left talon and the arrows in its
right talon are usually associated with plates designed prior to 1821.
It has been suggested that this is the plate worn by the West Point
cadets after 1821, but such seems doubtful.</p>

<p class="p2"> No Militia plates enjoyed wider use or longer life than those
patterned after the plate that disappeared from the Regular
Establishment with the disbanding of the dragoons in 1815. More than a
dozen die variants are known, several worn by more than one Militia
unit. Although size and shape may vary, any plate exhibiting a mounted
trooper with upraised saber can safely be assigned to mounted Militia.
However, the dating of such plates is a real problem because they are
known to have been in use as late as 1861.</p>

<p>A Huddy and Duval print of the Washington Cavalry of Philadelphia County
shows that unit <span class="pagenum"><a id="page67" name="page67"></a>(p. 67)</span> wearing a plate similar to the one used by the
Regulars, differing only in its brass composition, as opposed to the
original pewter of the 1812 regulations.<a id="footnotetag108" name="footnotetag108"></a><a href="#footnote108" title="Go to footnote 108"><span class="smaller">[108]</span></a> A cap in the collections
of the Valley Forge Museum that was worn by a member of this unit in the
period 1835-1845 is very similar to the one shown in the Huddy and Duval
print. The cap is a copy of the 1812 Regular Army pattern, with somewhat
more ornate brass bindings in place of the iron strips. A similar cap,
carrying the label "Canfield and Bro., Baltimore," is owned by
Lexington, Virginia, descendants of a member of the Rockbridge
[Virginia] Dragoons. That unit is said to have worn such a cap upon
first entering Confederate service in 1861.</p>

<p>In the national collections there is a dragoon cap (USNM 604767, S-K
912) carrying a plate of this design struck on a massive diamond-shaped
piece with concave sides. There are additional variations in several
private collections and at the Fort Ticonderoga Museum. The mounted
horseman device was also struck on heart-shaped martingale ornaments.</p>


<h4>CAP PLATE, DRAGOONS, C. 1830</h4>

</div>

<p>The horseman on this brass plate, designed with a rather crude,
childlike simplicity, is garbed quite differently than the Regular
dragoon on the 1812 pewter specimen. The plate is assigned to the
general 1830 period to fit the era of the diamond-shaped plates, but its
use doubtless continued on into the 1840's. By nature of its design it
would have been a manufacturer's stock pattern.</p>


<h4>CAP PLATE, ARTILLERY(?), C. 1830</h4>

<p class="smcap">Figure 131</p>
</div>

<p>The eagle on this brass plate is similar to the ones on the preceding
shield plates, but the Federal shield on which he stands is ornamented
with three star devices composed of smaller stars. An unusual feature of
this plate is the addition of the flaming portion of a grenade rising
from the eagle's head, a device not a part of any other known cap plate.
This <span class="pagenum"><a id="page68" name="page68"></a>(p. 68)</span> symbol suggests artillery, and the plate is of the proper
color. Although an unusual over-all design, the lack of any components
of state arms or crests indicate that it may have been a stock pattern.
The reverse is fitted with two simple bent-wire fasteners.</p>


<h4>CAP PLATE, MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY, C. 1830</h4>

<p class="smcap">Figure 132</p>
</div>

<p>This silver-on-copper plate bears the familiar elements of the
Massachusetts seal: Indian, in hunting shirt, with bow in right hand,
arrow with point downward in left hand, and star above right shoulder.
The crest&mdash;an arm grasping a broad sword on a wreath of the colors&mdash;is
superimposed on a burst of sun rays above. The State's motto is written
around the shield. The earlier plates containing elements of state arms
were for the most part confined to the States of Massachusetts,
Connecticut, and New York. No large plates bearing Pennsylvania State
symbols that can be dated prior to 1835 are known.</p>

<p>This seal was not authorized by law until 1885. However, the devices and
the motto were elements of the seal of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
ordered prepared by the state legislature in 1780 and, although
apparently never formally approved, used as such for many years. It
differs considerably in detail from the seal in use from 1629 to
1684.<a id="footnotetag109" name="footnotetag109"></a><a href="#footnote109" title="Go to footnote 109"><span class="smaller">[109]</span></a></p>

</div>

<p>This scalloped plate, which is struck in thin iron metal and silvered,
bears elements of the Massachusetts seal, minus the motto, and the
legend "<span class="smcap">Massachusetts Militia</span>." Its silver color assigns it <span class="pagenum"><a id="page69" name="page69"></a>(p. 69)</span> to
the infantry. The form of the specimen indicates that it was probably
designed prior to 1839. In consideration of its over-all design and the
use of the word "<span class="smcap">Militia</span>," it was probably made as a stock pattern and
sold to several different organizations. A plume holder, which has been
resoldered to the reverse, appears to be of the same metal as the plate
proper. It is pierced at the sides for attachment.</p>

<p class="p2"> Painted cap fronts were worn during the War of the Revolution by
several units of the Continental Army&mdash;including the Light Infantry
Company of the Canadian Regiment, Haslet's Delaware Regiment, and the
Rhode Island Train of Artillery<a id="footnotetag110" name="footnotetag110"></a><a href="#footnote110" title="Go to footnote 110"><span class="smaller">[110]</span></a>&mdash;and it is probable that the
practice continued among some volunteer corps up to the War of 1812.
Their use in the uniformed Militia units generally declined after the
introduction of die-struck metal cap plates. Two notable exceptions are
a cap plate of the Morris Rangers that is attached to a civilian-type
round hat of the 1812-1814 period<a id="footnotetag111" name="footnotetag111"></a><a href="#footnote111" title="Go to footnote 111"><span class="smaller">[111]</span></a> and the cap front described below
(fig. <a href="#img139">137</a>).</p>

<p>Although discarded by the more elite volunteer corps, painted metal hat
fronts in the "tombstone" shape similar to that of the Morris Rangers
continued to be used, to some extent, by the common Militia. Easily
attached to the ordinary civilian hat of the period, they provided the
common Militia a quick and inexpensive transformation from civilian to
military dress at their infrequent musters perhaps as late as 1840.
There are several contemporary sketches of these musters and in one,
dated 1829 (fig. <a href="#img136">134</a>), these "tombstone" plates can be identified.</p>

<a id="img136" name="img136"></a>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure 134.</span>&mdash;From Library of Congress print.</p>
</div>

<p>A total of perhaps a dozen of these hat fronts are known. Most are of
Connecticut origin, although at least two containing New York State
devices are extant. The most elaborate of these devices bears, oddly
enough, elements of the Connecticut State seal, the motto <i>Qui Trans.
Sust.</i>, and the crest of the Massachusetts coat of arms&mdash;an arm grasping
a broad-sword (fig. <a href="#img137">135</a>). The elaborate detail of this plate indicates
that it was probably an officer's. The fact that unit designations on
other such known hat fronts run as high as the "23d Regt." is definite
proof that these were devices of the common Militia as opposed to the
volunteer corps.</p>

<p>This painted front, of leather rather than metal, forms an integral part
of the cap itself. Edged in gold, it has the unit designation "<span class="smcap">LIGHT
INFANTRY</span>: 2d <span class="smcap">COMP.</span>" in gold at the top; a shield in the center contains
elements of the Connecticut State seal, and below it is the state motto

<p>A majority of these hat fronts are very similar in design, size, and
shape, and are painted over a black background on thin precut sheets of
tinned iron. This specimen carries a gold eagle with the Federal shield
on its breast and a ribbon in its beak. The unit <span class="pagenum"><a id="page71" name="page71"></a>(p. 71)</span> designation,
"2d <span class="smcap">COMP<sup>Y</sup>.</span> 23d <span class="smcap">REG<sup>T</sup>.</span>", also in gold, is below. The artwork, although
somewhat unartistically executed, has an attractive simplicity. Other
such hat fronts in the national collections are of the 2d Company, 6th
Regiment; 3d Company, 6th Regiment; and 1st Company, 8th Regiment. The
plate shown here has metal loops soldered to the reverse close to the
edge midway between top and bottom for attachment to a civilian type hat
by means of a ribbon or strip of cloth. Other such plates have hole for
attachment with string.</p>


<h4>CAP PLATE, SOUTH CAROLINA, c. 1835-1850</h4>

</div>

<p>This crescent-shaped, silver-on-copper plate bears an eagle that is very
similar in design to the one adopted by the Regular Army in 1821.
Sometimes mistakenly identified as a gorget because of its shape, the
crescent form of the specimen is an old South Carolina State heraldic
device. A cap worn by the Charleston Light Dragoons after the Civil War,
and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page72" name="page72"></a>(p. 72)</span> probably before, carries a similar crescent-shaped plate,
with the familiar palmetto tree device substituted for the eagle.<a id="footnotetag112" name="footnotetag112"></a><a href="#footnote112" title="Go to footnote 112"><span class="smaller">[112]</span></a>
The design of the eagle, however, places this piece in the 1835-1850
period. A silvered ornament, it may have been made originally for either
infantry or dragoons, and must be considered a manufacturer's stock
pattern.</p>


<h4>CAP PLATE, WASHINGTON GRAYS, C. 1835</h4>

<p>This brass, diamond-shaped plate was worn by the Washington Grays, a
light artillery outfit of Philadelphia. Within a raised oval are a
profile of Washington&mdash;with his shoulders draped in a toga, a typically
neoclassic touch&mdash;and, below, the unit designation "<span class="smcap">GRAYS</span>" in raised
letters. A matching oval shoulder-belt plate struck from the same die is
known.<a id="footnotetag113" name="footnotetag113"></a><a href="#footnote113" title="Go to footnote 113"><span class="smaller">[113]</span></a></p>

<p>Many Militia units named themselves after prominent military

worn by the National Greys; however, with such a nondistinctive center
ornament as the rosette of six petals, it must surely have been a stock
pattern sold to many different organizations. The sunburst proper is
struck in brass, as is the rosette, and each of the rays is pierced at
the end for attachment. The rosette is affixed with a brass bolt, also
for attachment, which must have extended through the front of the cap.</p>


<h4>CAP PLATE, ARTILLERY, C. 1840-1850</h4>

<p>This plate is struck in very thin brass. The combination of devices in
the design, especially of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page73" name="page73"></a>(p. 73)</span> cannon and cannon balls,
indicates that it was probably made for Militia artillery. Its shape
suggests that it may have been worn high on the cap front, with the
sunburst serving an added function as a cockade of sorts. It was very
probably a stock pattern.</p>


<h4>CAP PLATE, MOUNTED TROOPS, C. 1836</h4>

<p>From the size of this brass plate it can be assumed that it was worn
without other ornament on the front of the round leather cap associated
with mounted troops. The upper portion of the shield bears 8-pointed
stars, an unusual feature. The arrows in the eagle's left talon point
inward, a characteristic of eagle representation between 1832 and 1836.
The plate is known both in brass and with silver finish. It was probably
a stock pattern issued to both cavalry and mounted artillery.</p>


<h4>CAP EAGLE, C. 1836</h4>

<p>This brass eagle was worn in combination with backgrounds of full-,
half-, and three-quarter sunbursts and as a single ornament on the cap
front. The inward-pointed arrows in the left talon place it in the
1832-1836 period. Known in both brass and silver-on-copper, it was a
popular stock pattern sold to many units.</p>

<p>Struck in copper, and silvered, this eagle, which is very similar in
design to that prescribed for the Regular Establishment in both 1821 and
1832, was made for Militia infantry from about 1836 to perhaps as late
as 1851. Specimens struck in brass are also known, and the same eagle is
found on half-sunburst backgrounds. It is quite possible that this is
the eagle illustrated in the Huddy and Duval prints as being worn by
both the Washington Blues of Philadelphia and the U.S. Marine
Corps.<a id="footnotetag115" name="footnotetag115"></a><a href="#footnote115" title="Go to footnote 115"><span class="smaller">[115]</span></a></p>

<p>This brass ornament is a die sample or unfinished badge. After the
circular device was trimmed from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page74" name="page74"></a>(p. 74)</span> the brass square, it would
have been worn as an officer's chapeau ornament or as a side ornament on
the round leather dragoon cap of the period. The four arrows in the
eagle's left talon are unusual.</p>

<p>This large, round chapeau cockade with its gold embroidery and sequins
on black-ribbed silk and its ring of 24 silver-metal stars appears to be
identical to cockades that have been shown as being worn around 1839 by
Gen. Edmund P. Gaines and Gen. Winfield Scott<a id="footnotetag116" name="footnotetag116"></a><a href="#footnote116" title="Go to footnote 116"><span class="smaller">[116]</span></a> but without the added
center eagle. Close examination of this cockade shows it to be complete,
with no traces of a center eagle ever having been added. The 24 stars
would have been appropriate at any time between 1821 and 1836.</p>

<p>The Jackson Artillerists of Philadelphia, after the appearance of the
regular dragoon cap plate in 1833 and the large crossed cannon of the
regular artillery one year later, lost no time in combining these two
devices to make their distinctive cap device.<a id="footnotetag117" name="footnotetag117"></a><a href="#footnote117" title="Go to footnote 117"><span class="smaller">[117]</span></a> It seems probable,
however, that the plate was adopted by other artillery units and
eventually became more or less of a stock pattern.</p>

<p>This uncut, brass cap plate may have been a manufacturer's die strike
sent out as a sample, with others, so that a distant Militia
organization could select a pattern. The finished plate is known on a
bell-crown cap of the pattern of the 1820's, but its design indicates
that it probably should be dated after 1834 when the Regular artillery
first adopted the crossed-cannon device. The eagle is distinctly similar
to the one adopted by the Regulars in lieu of cap plates in 1821, and
the modified sunburst background probably was taken from the 1833
dragoon device.</p>

<p>This cap plate is a somewhat wider variation of the 1833 dragoon device
than most of the Militia plates of that type popular in the late 1830's
and the 1840's. While the brass sunburst has the usual 8-pointed form,
the eagle, applied to the center, is unusually small (1-3/8 by 1 in.)
and gives every indication of having been originally designed as a
cockade eagle at a somewhat earlier period.</p>

<a id="footnotetag118" name="footnotetag118"></a><a href="#footnote118" title="Go to footnote 118"><span class="smaller">[118]</span></a> and possibly by other units of the period. Both the eagle and the
half-sunburst were obviously stock items.</p>

<p>This silver-metal plate can be accurately identified by reading its
devices. The center device is from the seal of the State of Georgia.
During the period that the plate was worn, one of the best known of the
State's Militia organizations was the Republican Blues&mdash;the "<span class="smcap">RB</span>" on the
plate&mdash;of Savannah.<a id="footnotetag119" name="footnotetag119"></a><a href="#footnote119" title="Go to footnote 119"><span class="smaller">[119]</span></a> The silver color of the plate also agrees with

<p>This three-quarter-sunburst plate with the monogram "<span class="smcap">I D</span>" applied in
silver is identical to one on a brass-bound dragoon cap in the national
collections carrying in its crown the label "Irish Dragoons, Brooklyn,
N.Y." (USNM 604691, S-K 837). It is typical of the two-piece
sunburst-type plates and was probably worn until the 1850's. The plate
was attached by means of two looped-wire fasteners that were run through
holes in the helmet and secured by leather thongs.</p>

<p>With no regulations but their own to restrain them, Militia
organizations designed their uniforms to suit their fancies, although
generally following the regulations <span class="pagenum"><a id="page79" name="page79"></a>(p. 79)</span> for the Regulars. This
often led to odd and unusual cap shapes and trimmings and bindings on
clothing, and to somewhat garish horse furniture in in some mounted
units.</p>

<p>The illustrated cap and plate is very similar to the ones worn by the
Boston Light Infantry<a id="footnotetag120" name="footnotetag120"></a><a href="#footnote120" title="Go to footnote 120"><span class="smaller">[120]</span></a> about 1839-1840 except that the upper or
"mortar board" portion is beige instead of red and the plate is a full
instead of a three-quarter sunburst. The mortar board form is that
introduced by the Polish lancers in Europe in the early years of the
19th century and worn by most European lancer regiments of the same
period. Lancer units in the British Army adopted this type cap in 1816
when they were first converted from light dragoons.<a id="footnotetag121" name="footnotetag121"></a><a href="#footnote121" title="Go to footnote 121"><span class="smaller">[121]</span></a> The large,
brass, eagle-on-sunburst plate was obviously patterned after the one
prescribed for the Regular dragoons in 1833.</p>

<p>As an example of more than a dozen known variants of the eagle, this
silver-on-copper specimen is illustrated to show the general form and
size of Militia cockade eagles that became distinct types in the 1830's
and continued until about 1851. All such eagles were obviously stock
patterns.</p>

<p>This gold-embroidered cockade eagle with a wreath of silver lam about
its breast appears to have been patterned directly after the eagle on
the 1833 Regular dragoon cap plate (see fig. <a href="#img040">38</a>). It possibly is one of
a type worn by general officers of Militia. On this specimen, both the
eye and mouth of the eagle are indicated with red thread.</p>

<p>This gold-embroidered eagle, with wings and tail of gold embroidery and
gold sequins, was worn by staff and field officers, and possibly general
officers, of Militia. A duplicate on an original chapeau is in the
collections of the Maryland Historical Society in Baltimore, Maryland.
Eagle ornaments such as this were generally centered on a round cloth
cockade about 6 inches in diameter. The eagle's mouth is indicated by
embroidery with red thread. Similar eagles of a smaller size are known
on epaulets of the same period.</p>

<p>The flaming grenade, adopted by the Regulars in 1832 after long usage by
the British and other foreign armies, was quickly adopted by the
Militia. This specimen, of silver-on-copper, was worn as a cap plate
either in conjunction with another device below it on the cap front or
as a lone distinctive ornament. It cannot precisely be identified as an
artillery plate, but since some Militia artillery units are definitely
known to have worn silver buttons of the artillery pattern, such is
highly probable. Also known in brass and in smaller sizes, it is a stock
pattern.</p>

<p>Although this plate appears to be of possible French or British origin,
close examination indicates that it is probably an American Militia
device of the 1840's. Its looped-wire fasteners indicate that it is a
cap plate. The design of the modified Napoleonic-type eagle is almost
exactly that used in the 1833 Regular dragoon cap plate and other
Militia plates; and the period of apparent manufacture coincides with
the early use of the flaming grenade as an American device.
Incorporating two devices common to the period, it would have been a
stock pattern.</p>

<p>The 1840 button for the Ordnance Corps bears a flaming grenade over
crossed cannon, devices that date from 1832 and 1834 respectively.
Consequently, it seems likely that this combination emerged as a stock
pattern for Militia artillery early in the 1840's. This specimen, struck
from a single piece of brass, is a copy of the French artillery device
of the same period, and, while it is believed to be American, it may be
a foreign insignia. Confusion arises in the case of foreign designs, for
die sinkers often used as a model either an actual imported badge or a
scale drawing of one.</p>

<p>This is a variation of the pattern of the preceding specimen in which
silver-metal devices have been placed on a small, gilt, half-sunburst
plate. This was probably a stock pattern available to any Militia
organization beginning about 1840 and worn for the next 20 or 30 years.</p>

<p>The palmetto of South Carolina in outline form first appeared as a large
cap ornament about 1840, after having been worn in smaller size as a
cockade ornament and on the side of dragoon caps. A Huddy and Duval
print shows it on the caps of the DeKalb Rifle Guards of Camden, South
Carolina.<a id="footnotetag122" name="footnotetag122"></a><a href="#footnote122" title="Go to footnote 122"><span class="smaller">[122]</span></a> The illustrated specimen was worn into the 1850's, and it
is highly probable that some South Carolina troops wore plates such as
this in the early days of the Civil War.</p>

<p>The palmetto was adopted as the principal heraldic device of South
Carolina in commemoration of the defeat of Admiral Sir Peter Parker's
fleet by the garrison of Sullivan's Island under Col. William Moultrie
in June 1776. The defenses of the island were constructed primarily of
palmetto logs. The devices comprising this brass plate are all taken
from the state seal, including the mottos <i>Animis Opibusque Parati</i> and
<i>Dum Spiro Spero Spes</i>. The date "1776" alludes to the year of
Moultrie's victory and not to the organization date of any particular
unit.</p>

<p>This grenadier-type plate, struck in brass, is one of the most beautiful
examples of the die maker's art in the national collections. On a
sunburst-over-clouds <span class="pagenum"><a id="page82" name="page82"></a>(p. 82)</span> background is an eagle grasping the top of
the Federal shield superimposed on panoply of arms and colors. The
national motto is on a ribbon below. Certainly not from a stock pattern,
this plate obviously was made for a specific Militia unit of
considerable affluence. Three simple wire fasteners soldered to the
reverse provide means of attachment.</p>

<p>This specimen is one of the scarce examples of military plates bearing
the maker's name "<span class="smcap">BALE</span>," which may be seen just above the raised lower
edge and below the "<span class="smcap">UNUM</span>." This was probably Thomas Bale of New York who
is first listed in New York directories, in 1832, as an engraver at 68
Nassau Street. The 1842 directory lists him as a die sinker at the same
address in partnership with a Frederick B. Smith. He is last listed in
1851.</p>

<p>The plate on this cap uses only the shield of the Pennsylvania seal
without crest or supporters. It is surrounded at the sides and bottom
with a wreath carrying a ribbon with the unit designation "first
artily." Equally interesting and unusual is the small separate insignia
at the pompon socket. It is based on the 1840 flaming grenade ordnance
device with crossed cannon superimposed.</p>

talon is an even more unusual variation. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page83" name="page83"></a>(p. 83)</span> It is believed to be a
cockade eagle because of its form and size, but it may well have been
used elsewhere on the person as a piece of uniform insignia.</p>


<h4>CHAPEAU COCKADE, STATE FENCIBLES (PENNSYLVANIA), C. 1840</h4>

<p>The State Fencibles of Philadelphia were originally organized as "Sea
Fencibles" in 1812 for duty at the port of Philadelphia. This cockade,
with brass eagle, was first worn about 1840 and it continued in use for
many years thereafter. Dates incorporated as parts of devices are
generally the original organizational dates of the units concerned&mdash;as
is the case in this instance&mdash;and bear no necessary relation to the age
of the badges. Some Militia cap plates bear the date "1776," and there
are waist-belt plates bearing organization dates of 100 years earlier
than the dates at which the plates were made.</p>

<p class="p2"> The transition to composite plates in the late 1830's was a tremendous
step forward in the field of military ornament. Handsome insignia could
be manufactured less expensively and individual units were able to have
plates distinctive to themselves at relatively low cost; however, only
gold and silver colors could be used. In the mid-1840's there was
introduced a new manufacturing technique which opened this field even
wider. In this innovation, various stock patterns were struck with a
round center as a part of the design. In either the initial strike, or a
second, this round center was punched out, leaving a hole. Then pieces
of colored leather or painted tin, carrying distinctive numerals,
letters, monograms, or other devices were affixed to the reverse of the
plate, in effect filling the hole. Although this added a step in
manufacture, it permitted the incorporation of bright colors, which
added zest and sparkle to the finished product. Such plates remained
popular until the 1890's, and a few are still worn on the full-dress
caps of some units. This type of insignia came into use at the time when
many of the independent companies <span class="pagenum"><a id="page84" name="page84"></a>(p. 84)</span> of the larger states, such as
New York and Pennsylvania, were starting to become elements of regiments
and brigades within the over-all Militia structure of the state, thus
the use of distinctive numbers and/or letters on the badges. Many of
these units, however, retained their original designation<a id="footnotetag123" name="footnotetag123"></a><a href="#footnote123" title="Go to footnote 123"><span class="smaller">[123]</span></a> and
continued to wear insignia distinctive to themselves on full-dress
uniforms.</p>

arms. This plate, and those following, were worn through the 1850's on
the dress cap copied after the pattern adopted for the Regular
Establishment in 1851. It is struck in brass.</p>

October 8, 1833. The arms and the motto "<span class="smcap">ASSIDUITY</span>", appearing above the
ribbon with the letters "<span class="smcap">A B C</span>," are those of the city of Albany.</p>

<p>The original buttons on the sides of this cap have the eagle with the
letter "<span class="smcap">R</span>" (used by both Regulars and Militia) on the shield. The brass
plate proper, however, includes no device indicative of any particular
branch of service; combining flags and a Federal <span class="pagenum"><a id="page86" name="page86"></a>(p. 86)</span> shield
surmounted by an eagle, it may well have been a stock pattern.</p>

<p>The type and form of this eagle plate give no clue to its age, or to the
identity of the unit that wore it other than the numeral "1" in the
eagle's beak and the letter "<span class="smcap">E</span>" in the shield. It is a type more apt to
have been made about 1850 than later. The eagle is struck in brass, and
the stippled inner portion of the shield, product of a separate strike,
is soldered in place; thus, the plate proper must be considered a stock
pattern.</p>

<p>This plate is of a type form worn on Militia dress caps prior to the
Civil War. There is little doubt that plates such as this continued in
use for several decades after their initial appearance. This brass
specimen, surmounted by elements of the Massachusetts seal, is struck as
a stock pattern for Massachusetts troops with the center left blank. The
numeral "10" is applied to a black-painted metal disk affixed with
simple wire fasteners.</p>

<p>This plate and the one following are of Militia types worn on caps in
the 1850's and perhaps earlier. Such plates are known to have been in
use with little or no change almost to the present day on military
school dress shakos and dress caps worn by some National Guard units.
The plate proper, which is of brass, is the well-known half-sunburst
device so popular in the 1830's and 1840's. The Georgia state seal, also
in brass, is applied with wire fasteners. The plate is dated later than
a similar one of the Republican Blues (fig. <a href="#img154">152</a>) because of the "feel"
of the piece and the fact that it cannot be ascribed to a particular
unit whose existence can be dated.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly one of the most interesting of all the Militia plates of the
War of 1812 period is this rectangular one worn by John S. Stiles of (as
indicated by the engraving) the "First Marine Artillery of the Union."
Engraved in brass, it bears an unusual combination of military and naval
devices&mdash;the familiar eagle-on-cannon of the Regular artillery and the
eagle with oval shield that appears on naval officers' buttons of the
period.<a id="footnotetag124" name="footnotetag124"></a><a href="#footnote124" title="Go to footnote 124"><span class="smaller">[124]</span></a> Actually, the devices befit the character of the
organization. The following quotation from <i>Niles Weekly Register</i> of
Baltimore, June 26, 1813, tells something of the unit:</p>

<p class="quote">The First Marine Artillery of the Union, an association of the
     masters and mates of vessels in Baltimore, about 170 strong all
     told, assembled on Sunday last and proceeded to the Rev. Mr.
     Glendy's church in full uniform, where they received an address
     suited to the occasion; which, as usual, done honor to the head
     and heart to the reverend orator. We cannot pass over this
     pleasant incident without observing that the members of this
     invaluable corps are they who, of all other classes of society,
     feel the burthens and privations of the war.</p>

<p>Obviously, this organization was one of the state fencible units
enlisted for defense only, but little else is known about it. In 1814
there was in Baltimore, a Corps of Marine Artillery commanded by a Capt.
George Stiles. The roster of this unit, however, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page89" name="page89"></a>(p. 89)</span> does not
include the name John S. Stiles. Other records do indicate that a Lt.
John S. Stiles commanded a section of the Baltimore Union Artillery at
the Battle of North Point in 1814.<a id="footnotetag125" name="footnotetag125"></a><a href="#footnote125" title="Go to footnote 125"><span class="smaller">[125]</span></a> It is probable that John Stiles,
originally a member of the 1st Marine Artillery of the Union had
transferred his commission to the Baltimore Union Artillery.</p>

<p class="p2"> An example of Militia officers' shoulder-belt plates of the period
1812-1816 is a solid silver oval plate (fig. <a href="#img180">178</a>) engraved with an eagle
and elements of the arms of Massachusetts within a shield suspended from
the eagle's neck. Being silver, the plate probably was worn by infantry
or possibly dragoons. Many such <span class="pagenum"><a id="page90" name="page90"></a>(p. 90)</span> plates were locally made, as
was this one, and examination of a number of specimens gives reason to
believe that many were made by rolling out large silver coins into thin
ovals, which were then engraved and fitted with fasteners on the
reverse. The fasteners on all pieces studied indicate that the plates
were intended to be ornamental rather than functional.</p>

<a id="img180" name="img180"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img180.jpg" width="300" height="375" alt="" title="">
<p><span class="smcap">Figure 178.</span>&mdash;Specimen in Campbell collection.</p>
</div>

<p>In the Pennsylvania State Museum there is a similar oval plate that was
worn by Col. Philip Spengler of that State's Militia in 1812-1816.
Ornamented with an eagle, with the initials "<span class="smcap">PS</span>" within an oval below,
it generally follows the construction of the illustrated plate,
differing only slightly in size. Since plates of this general type were
made locally by hand, each is unique in itself. Identification must
depend upon an interpretation of the devices engraved on the face. The
initials of the officer for whom the plate was made are often included.</p>


<h4>SHOULDER-BELT PLATE, C. 1812</h4>

<p class="center"><i>USNM 604310-M (S-K 466). Figure 179.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img181.jpg" width="300" height="219" alt="" title="">
<p class="smcap">Figure 179</p>
</div>

<p>A second example of a Militia officer's plate is this engraved brass
specimen with the design placed along the longer axis of the oval. Since
there probably were many "Volunteer Rifle Companies," it is impossible
to determine precisely which one wore this plate. The initials of the
officer may be read either "<span class="smcap">I. B.</span>" or "<span class="smcap">J. B.,</span>" for many of the
early-19th-century engravers used the forms of the letters "<span class="smcap">I</span>" and "<span class="smcap">J</span>"
interchangeably. The two small hooks on the reverse indicate that the
plate was for a shoulder belt rather than for a waist belt, and that it
was ornamental rather than functional.</p>


<h4>SHOULDER-BELT BUCKLE, C. 1812(?)</h4>

<p class="center"><i>USNM 60325-M (S-K 81). Figure 180.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img182.jpg" width="300" height="436" alt="" title="">
<p class="smcap">Figure 180</p>
</div>

<p>This brass buckle, obviously made for a sword hanger, has an eagle in
flight above, a 13-star flag below, and four 5-pointed stars on either
side. The spearhead on the pike of the flag is definitely of military
design, and, in the absence of nautical devices in the engraving, the
buckle must be considered an army item.</p>


<h4>ORNAMENTED WAIST-BELT PLATE, 1812-1825(?)</h4>

<p class="center"><i>USNM 604121-M (S-K 278). Figure 181.</i></p>

<p class="smcap">Figure 181</p>
</div>

<p>Cast in silver and then carefully finished, this rectangular plate with
beveled edge is one of the most ornate and beautiful known. In the
center is an officer's marquee with an eagle, wings spread, perched on
top. In front of the marquee are a field piece with bombs, cannon balls,
and drum; the whole on grassy ground and superimposed on a trophy of
colors and bayonetted muskets. The canton of one color has, instead of
stars, an eagle with a shield on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page91" name="page91"></a>(p. 91)</span> its breast and a ribbon in its
beak. It has been suggested that the eagle-in-canton flag would tend to
date the piece after 1820 when many Militia units had the design in its
colors;<a id="footnotetag126" name="footnotetag126"></a><a href="#footnote126" title="Go to footnote 126"><span class="smaller">[126]</span></a> however, flags of such design are known to have been used
as early as the last year of the Revolution.<a id="footnotetag127" name="footnotetag127"></a><a href="#footnote127" title="Go to footnote 127"><span class="smaller">[127]</span></a> In addition, the
"feel" of the specimen is early, and it is included here as a possible
Militia dragoon officer's plate since the dragoons of the War of 1812
period generally wore their swords attached to a waist belt rather than
to a shoulder belt.</p>


<h4>WAIST-BELT PLATE, INFANTRY, 1814-1825(?)</h4>

<p class="center"><i>USNM 60449-M (S-K 205). Figure 182.</i></p>

<a id="img184" name="img184"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img184.jpg" width="300" height="250" alt="" title="">
<p class="smcap">Figure 182</p>
</div>

<p>This plate is typical of the early waist-belt plates, which generally
were more square than rectangular. It bears the over-all design of the
1814-1821 series of "common" cap plates. Struck in copper and silvered,
it would have been appropriate for either infantry or dragoons, as both
wore "white metal" trimmings during this period. There are as many die
variations known for this type belt plate as for the matching cap
plates.</p>

<p>The wide latitude allowed officers in selecting their own insignia makes
it quite possible that this design was worn by some officers of the
Regular Establishment, particularly those in the high-numbered
regiments, which were organized during the course of the War of 1812. A
third use of this basic design is indicated by a museum specimen at Fort
Ticonderoga, N.Y.: cut into its outline form, it was worn on the side of
Militia dragoon caps.</p>


<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page92" name="page92"></a>(p. 92)</span> WAIST-BELT PLATE, INFANTRY, 1814-1825(?)</h4>

<p class="smcap">Figure 183</p>
</div>

<p>This brass plate is one of several similar examples made of both brass
and silvered copper that differ only in small die variations and the use
of either 5-pointed or 6-pointed stars. The arc of 17 stars in this
specimen may or may not be significant, because there were 17 states in
the Union from 1802 until 1812 when Louisiana was admitted. Not until
1816 did the 19th state, Indiana, come into the Union. After thinking in
terms of and working with 17 stars for a 10-year period, die sinkers may
well have overlooked the inclusion of a star for Louisiana. Buttons for
the Regular rifles made after 1812 but before 1821 show an arc of 17
stars.<a id="footnotetag128" name="footnotetag128"></a><a href="#footnote128" title="Go to footnote 128"><span class="smaller">[128]</span></a> As in the case of the preceding plate, there is a good
possibility that this one was worn by Regular officers in 1814-1821. It
is also probable that the pattern was made and sold to Militia for many
years after 1821.</p>


<h4>WAIST-BELT PLATE, MILITIA ARTILLERY, C. 1821-1840(?)</h4>

<p class="center"><i>USNM 60453-M (S-K 209). Figure 184.</i></p>

<img src="images/img186.jpg" width="300" height="199" alt="" title="">
<p class="smcap">Figure 184</p>
</div>

<p>While this plate could have been worn by an officer of the Regular
artillery in the period 1814-1821 when uniform regulations were vague
and seldom enforced, it is more probable that it was a Militia item of
about 1821-1835. The reason for this is that the eagle-on-cannon device
was adopted quickly by Militia units when it was discarded by the
Regulars in 1821, and the over-all design of the plate itself follows
the pattern adopted by the Regulars in 1821 (see fig. <a href="#img070">68</a>). Several
artillery organizations of the Massachusetts Militia wore the discarded
button pattern (eagle-on-cannon with the word "<span class="smcap">Corps</span>" below) until the
1840's,<a id="footnotetag129" name="footnotetag129"></a><a href="#footnote129" title="Go to footnote 129"><span class="smaller">[129]</span></a> and this plate would have been an ideal match.</p>

<p>The whole is cast in brass, the inner ring rather crudely so. The outer
ring is embossed with zig-zag fretwork enclosing a circle of 5-pointed
stars; the rectangular belt attachments have a floral design.</p>


<h4>WAIST-BELT PLATE, MAINE, C. 1821</h4>

<p class="center"><i>USNM 604123 (S-K 279). Figure 185.</i></p>

<p class="smcap">Figure 185</p>
</div>

<p>This plate, struck in copper, contains the basic devices of the State of
Maine seal enclosed by a curled ribbon border embellished with 5-pointed
stars. The specimen is more square than rectangular, a characteristic of
waist-belt plates of the early 1800's. It was probably worn by Maine
Militia no later than the 1820's, possibly a few years earlier. The
method of attachment also is indicative of this early period: the heavy
vertical wire is brazed to one end of the reverse, and the L-shaped
tongue to the other. This plate obviously was a stock pattern.</p>


<h4><span class="pagenum"><a id="page93" name="page93"></a>(p. 93)</span> WAIST-BELT PLATE, C. 1830</h4>

<p>This plate, cast in brass, is typical of the small plates, both round
and rectangular, that were worn with light-weight, full-dress staff
swords. It is an example of the early, hand-made, bench-assembled types.
The outer ring carries the wreath typical of the period, while the inner
ring carries the eagle with its head to the right, shield on breast,
arrows in left talon, and olive branch in right talon. The whole lies
within a ring of 13 5-pointed stars; the uppermost five stars are mixed
with a sunburst rising from the eagle's wings.</p>


<h4>WAIST-BELT PLATE, C. 1821(?)-1830</h4>

</div>

<p>This brass, bench-assembled plate is similar to the Regular artillery
belt plate of 1816 (fig. <a href="#img058">56</a>) in that the design on the inner ring is
struck with a series of separate hand-held dies on a piece of blank
round stock. The floral design on the belt attachments is cast. In many
of the early bench-made plates, the final assemblyman marked the
matching pairs so that they could readily be re-paired after buffing and
plating. In this specimen, each ring bears the numeral <span class="smcap">XXVIII</span>.</p>


<h4>WAIST-BELT PLATE, NEW YORK, C. 1830</h4>

<p>This plate, with the center ring struck in medium brass and the belt
attachment cast, was worn by Militia of New York State, as indicated by
the eagle-on-half-globe device taken from that state's seal. Of brass,
it is assigned to the artillery. The quality of the belt to which it is
attached and the ornateness of the plate itself indicate that it was
made for an officer. The left-hand belt attachment is missing.</p>


<h4>WAIST-BELT PLATE, C. 1830</h4>

</div>

<p>This small, cast-brass plate is another example of the plates made for
social or full-dress wear with the light-weight staff sword. The design
on the inner ring is unusual in that the eagle, with upraised wings, is
standing on the Federal shield. The plate is a bench-made product, with
the inner and outer rings <span class="pagenum"><a id="page94" name="page94"></a>(p. 94)</span> bearing the numeral <span class="smcap">VII</span>. It was very
probably a stock pattern for officers.</p>


<h4>WAIST-BELT PLATE, C. 1836</h4>

</div>

<p>Rather unusual in construction, this small silver-on-copper rectangular
plate was struck in thin metal. Two broad tongues, for attachment to a
belt, are inserted in the rear; and the reverse is filled with lead to
imbed the fasteners. The eagle design is very similar to the one
prescribed for the caps of the Regular Establishment in 1821, although
somewhat reduced in size. The general lack of finish and polish in
construction indicates that the specimen was probably the product of an
inexperienced and small-scale manufacturer.</p>


<h4>OFFICER'S WAIST-BELT PLATE, C. 1837</h4>

</div>

<p>This unusually large plate, which is struck in medium brass and with the
edges crimped over a heavier piece of brass backing, is believed to be
an officer's plate because of its size, gilt finish, and over-all ornate
design. Within a floral and star pattern border, the specimen is
dominated by an eagle, on a sunburst background, that holds in its left
talon five arrows with points inward; above are 25 stars and an edge of
clouds above. Arrows held with points inward are usually considered
indicative of the general period <span class="pagenum"><a id="page95" name="page95"></a>(p. 95)</span> 1832-1836. If the number of
stars is of any significance, such dating would be correct, as the
canton of the National Colors contained 25 stars from 1836 to 1837. The
central design used without the border is also known in smaller, more
standard sized plates. The design is a stock pattern. This type plate is
also known in both brass and silver.</p>


<h4>SHOULDER-BELT PLATE, WASHINGTON GRAYS, C. 1835</h4>

<p>This may well be a companion piece to the diamond-shaped cap plate
ascribed to the Washington Greys<a id="footnotetag130" name="footnotetag130"></a><a href="#footnote130" title="Go to footnote 130"><span class="smaller">[130]</span></a> of Philadelphia (see fig. <a href="#img141">139</a>). In
any case, the two appear to have been struck from the same die. It may
also have been worn by the Washington Greys of Reading, Pennsylvania, or
by another company of the same designation. The specimen is struck in
thin brass with a tin backing applied before the strike and the edges
crimped over the reverse. Three soldered copper-wire staples provide
means of attachment.</p>

<p class="p2"> Militia organizations generally modeled their uniforms rather closely
on those of the Regular Establishment; of course, there were certain
exceptions, notably the flamboyant Zouave units. However, the Militia
often added additional trimmings that gave the "gay and gaudy" touch for
which they were noted. Following the example of the Regulars, the
Militia adopted coat-skirt ornaments almost immediately after their
appearance in 1832. They used the regulation flaming grenades, open and
looped horns, and 5-and 6-pointed stars, but in both gold and silver on
varicolored backgrounds and in a wide variety of sizes. They also used a
number of peculiarly Militia forms, such as crossed-cannon, elements of
state seals, and devices peculiar to specific units.</p>

<p>Typical of Militia coat-skirt ornaments is this pair of crossed cannon
devices for Militia artillery. They are of gold embroidery on a
background of black velvet. Similar pairs in the national collections
are embroidered in silver. The Regular artillery never wore the crossed
cannon device on the skirt of the coat; so used, it was exclusively a
Militia ornament.</p>

<p>Another coat-skirt ornament with an even more distinctly Militia touch
is this small palmetto tree of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page96" name="page96"></a>(p. 96)</span> gold embroidery, with sequins,
on black wool cloth. As the palmetto tree is the basic device of the
South Carolina seal (see pp. <a href="#page81">81</a> and <a href="#page83">83</a>), this specimen must be
attributed to the Militia of that state.</p>

<p class="p2"> Most Militia cartridge-box plates made in the decade after 1841 were
oval, following the pattern of the Regulars. While a few of these varied
from the prescribed sizes, most were almost identical in both size and
shape to those of the Regular Establishment, but with strictly Militia
ornamentation. The exact years in which these plates were produced
cannot be determined, but it is reasonably sure that they were supplied
to Militia for some years prior to the opening of the Civil War. Not
included here are similar types known to have been made for units born
of the war as the Pennsylvania Fire Zouaves, Pennsylvania Home Guard,
Pennsylvania Reserve Brigade, and the Ohio Volunteer Militia.
Cartridge-box and waist-belt plates often are identical except for the
methods of attachment. The plates for cartridge boxes have two wire
loops imbedded in the backing (see fig. <a href="#img092">90</a>), while those for waist belts
have one or two round, or sometimes arrowheaded, prongs on one side of
the reverse, and with a narrow tongue on the opposite side bent parallel
to the plane of the plate (see fig. <a href="#img093">91</a>).</p>

<p>This brass, oval cartridge-box plate, with its eagle on a panoply of
arms and colors, closely matches in size the 1841 Regular cavalry's
plates for carbine cartridge boxes and the infantry's waist belts.
Although plates of this design were worn as waist-belt plates, the two
looped-wire fasteners on the reverse of this specimen clearly indicate
its use on a cartridge box. This was undoubtedly a stock pattern. An oil
painting of Capt. George Bumm, Pennsylvania State Artillery, c. 1840,
shows the subject wearing a waist-belt plate of this same design.<a id="footnotetag131" name="footnotetag131"></a><a href="#footnote131" title="Go to footnote 131"><span class="smaller">[131]</span></a></p>

<p>Slightly smaller than the preceding specimen, this brass plate bears the
eagle design popular from 1821 to 1851. Fitted with looped-wire

<p>A frequently misidentified plate is this brass-struck, lead-filled oval
with the raised letters "<span class="smcap">VMM</span>" for Volunteer Maine Militia. It is also
known in a smaller size. The reverse is fitted with the two looped-wire
fasteners normal to such plates.</p>

<p>Other prewar oval plates bearing raised letters are known for the
Alabama Volunteer Corps (AVC), North Carolina (NC), South Carolina (SC),
State of New York (SNY), and New Hampshire State Militia (NHSM). Many
such plates recently have been reproduced for sale, and more probably
will be made <span class="pagenum"><a id="page97" name="page97"></a>(p. 97)</span> if a market is created. Thus, all plates of this
general type should be cautiously considered.</p>

<p>One of the more unusual forms of the militant eagle used on ornaments is
shown on this brass die sample for a waist-belt plate. The eagle, with
fierce mien and wings outspread, stands high on a craggy ledge. An
example of an untold number of odd and unusual pieces of insignia, this
specimen is unidentified as to unit or area of intended use. It may well
have been designed for use as a stock pattern.</p>


<h4>WAIST-BELT PLATE, RIFLEMEN, C. 1840</h4>

<p>A stock pattern, this plate is struck in brass with the open-horn device
of riflemen, which has been previously discussed. Wire fasteners are on
the reverse. Although the outer ring of the plate is missing, it was
probably decorated with a wreath, a common form in the 1830's and
1840's.</p>


<h4>WAIST-BELT PLATE, CHARLESTOWN ARTILLERY, C. 1840</h4>

<p>This 2-piece, brass-cast plate was worn by members of a Charlestown,
Massachusetts, unit. The date <span class="pagenum"><a id="page98" name="page98"></a>(p. 98)</span> "1786," as on nearly all dated
pieces of insignia, refers to the date of original organization of the
unit. The design of the plate is typical of early- to mid-Victorian
taste.</p>


<h4>WAIST-BELT PLATE, MASSACHUSETTS, C. 1840</h4>

<p>Bearing elements of the seal of the State of Massachusetts, this plate
likely was a stock pattern sold to many officers. In construction, it is
a composite piece similar to the plate for officers of the Corps of
Topographical Engineers (see fig. <a href="#img089">87</a> and p. <a href="#page45">45</a>) with the device applied
to the inner oval. Because of its unusually striking appearance, it
would have been a most appropriate type for staff and field officers,
and possibly general officers.</p>


<h4>WAIST-BELT PLATE, NEW YORK, C. 1840</h4>

<p>This plate, struck in poor-quality, medium-weight brass, is of a stock
pattern bearing the eagle-on-half-globe device and the motto "Excelsior"
from the New York State seal superimposed on a panoply of arms and
colors. This type of belt plate, with the device on the inner panel and
a wreath between the inner and outer borders, is most characteristic of
the 1840's. More than ten different plates are known that vary only as
to the design of the inner panel; some contain New York State heraldic
devices, and others contain variants of the usual eagle design of the
period.</p>


<h4>WAIST-BELT PLATE, PHILADELPHIA, C. 1840</h4>

<p>The devices on this cast-brass plate comprise the arms of the City of
Philadelphia, and its form and pattern, especially the floral design of
the outer ring, place it in the 1840's. The piece is bench-made and
carries on the reverse many marks of the file used in its final
assembly. It must be considered a stock pattern.</p>


<h4>WAIST-BELT PLATE, SOUTH CAROLINA, C. 1840</h4>

<p>Somewhat larger than many plates of the period, this brass specimen
carries the South Carolina palmetto device. Such plates also were struck
in copper and silver plated. It obviously was a stock pattern <span class="pagenum"><a id="page99" name="page99"></a>(p. 99)</span>
sold to several different units. The rectangular plate with the
vine-patterned border was a stock pattern in itself, with many different
devices being added in the center as ordered. This is one of the many
pieces of insignia too often called Confederate but which ante-date the
Civil War by almost two decades.</p>


<h4>WAIST-BELT PLATE, C. 1840</h4>

<p>The eagle device on this silver-on-copper specimen closely resembles
that on the cap plate of the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry (USNM
604964-M) and may possibly be the matching belt-plate worn by that
organization. Such an eagle, however, would have been a stock pattern of
the manufacturer, and sold to many different units. A very unusual
aspect of this particular eagle are the three arrows held in the left
talon: two of them point inward, the third outward.</p>


<h4>WAIST-BELT PLATE, ARTILLERY, C. 1840</h4>

<p class="center"><i>USNM 604106-M (S-K 262). Figure 206.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Although members of the artillery of the Regular Establishment wore the
crossed-cannon device on their shakos, they never wore it on waist- or
shoulder-belt plates. Thus, this cast-brass plate must have been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>(p. 100)</span> a stock pattern sold to many Militia units. The outer ring is
missing.</p>


<h4>WAIST-BELT PLATE, C. 1840</h4>

<p class="center"><i>USNM 604107-M (S-K 263). Figure 207.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img209.jpg" width="300" height="208" alt="" title="">
<p class="smcap">Figure 207</p>
</div>

<p>This specimen, roughly cast in brass and gilded, is unusual because the
Militia rarely used the letters "<span class="smcap">U S</span>" on any of its equipment. The
pattern does not conform to anything prescribed for Regulars and the
quality does not come up to standards required by the Regular
Establishment; hence it must have been worn by Militia. It would have
been a stock pattern. There is the possibility that it might have been
worn by diplomatic personnel, but its poor quality makes this unlikely.</p>


<h4>WAIST-BELT PLATE, C. 1850</h4>

<p class="center"><i>USNM 604387-M (S-K 534). Figure 208.</i></p>

<p>The over-all design of this plate, which is cast roughly in brass and
gilded, reflects the growing ornateness of the Victorian era. Obviously
a stock pattern, it would have suited the fancy of several units and
cannot be identified further than "for Militia." The design of the eagle
is unusual in that three arrows are carried in the right talon&mdash;although
it is possible that this is intended to reflect the belligerency
inherent in the period of the War with Mexico&mdash;and there is a single
large star in the canton of the Federal shield.</p>


<h4>WAIST-BELT PLATE, C. 1840</h4>

<p class="center"><i>USNM 604458-M (S-K 605). Figure 209.</i></p>

<p class="smcap">Figure 209</p>
</div>

<p>The generalities that apply to all "stock pattern" insignia are equally
valid in referring to this brass-struck plate with a 5-pointed star as
its sole ornament. Dating its period of design poses no difficulty, for
it contains the panel with wreath inside an edging border characteristic
of the 1840's. The star device would have been appropriate for Militia
units of Maine ("North Star"), Texas ("Lone Star"), or for dragoon units
that took the star as a distinctive insignia. Although it may have been
worn by Texans, it is doubtful that it was made originally for them.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>(p. 101)</span> The design enjoyed a long life, and plates of this general
pattern were struck well into the 1880's. The major difference between
earlier and later specimens is that the early ones were struck on rather
heavy sheets of copper-colored brass, with fasteners consisting of a
tongue and heavy wire loops brazed to the reverse. The later plates have
a bright brassy color, are struck on thin brass, and have the loop and
tongue soldered rather than brazed.</p>

<p>The lack of a mane on the beast on this plate marks it as a tiger. The
best known and most affluent Militia organization with the nickname
"Tigers" was the Boston Light Infantry, although a number of others also
were so-called. The craftsmanship and general elegance of this
gold-plated brass specimen suggests that it was worn by an officer,
though an occasional volunteer company was so richly endowed that all
its members, officers and enlisted men alike, wore expensive devices.
The bench-assembled manufacturing technique, gaudy embellishment, and
lack of a distinct Victorian touch date the piece about 1840. The
tiger's head is applied.</p>

<p>The full-flowing mane on the beast on this plate identifies it as a
lion. The device would have been appropriate for wear by the Albany
Burgesses Corps, which, when founded in 1833, almost immediately adopted
the lion's head as its distinctive insignia. The unit continued to wear
this plate for about half a century. While that unit's cap plate (fig.
<a href="#img172">170</a>) is much more formal and is without a lion's head, its buttons
contain the lion&mdash;with head turned to half-right&mdash;as a principal
ornament. While it is probable that the original die for this cast-brass
plate was sunk for the Albany organization, the manufacturer would not
have hesitated to offer it for sale to any interested Militia unit.</p>

<p>The raised letters "<span class="smcap">W G</span>" on this cast-brass and gilded plate would have
been suitable for many <span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102"></a>(p. 102)</span> Militia units of the period. We can
only suggest that it may have been worn by members of a "Washington
Greys" or "Washington Guard" from Pennsylvania or New York. A round
plate with an outer wreath would have been more appropriate for officers
than for enlisted personnel.</p>

Washington Greys of Philadelphia and Reading, Pennsylvania, while
indistinct, are definitely not of this pattern. Thus, this brass plate
with its sunken letters filled with black enamel must have been worn by
yet a third unit with such a name. Additional specimens in the national
collections have the company letters "<span class="smcap">G</span>" and "<span class="smcap">K</span>."</p>

<p>This oval, convex, brass plate, with two studs and a hook soldered to
the reverse for attachment, very probably was originally a shoulder-belt
plate. The letters "<span class="smcap">W L G</span>" incised on the obverse are very patently the
added work of an engraver of no great talent. The letters doubtless
stand for Washington Light Guard, and, since there were several Militia
units of that designation, it seems possible that one of the less
affluent units bought the plates and had them engraved locally.</p>


<h4>WAIST-BELT PLATE, CITY GUARDS, C. 1840</h4>

<p>There were City Guards in Charleston, South Carolina, New York City,
Philadelphia, and possibly in other places. Thus it is impossible to
determine just which of these units wore this cast-brass plate. The
ornamented outer oval is typical of the 1840's.</p>

<p>A number of Militia units carried the designation "National Guard." The
unit that used this particular plate was from New Jersey, for scratched
on the reverse is "Sergeant O. Clinton, October 9th, 1851, 1st Reg
Hudson Brigade, NJSM"; However, the adjutant general, State of New
Jersey, was unable to give any information on such an organization. The
specimen is cut from rolled brass with sunken letters filled with black
enamel.</p>

<p class="p2"> Shoulder-belt plates underwent the same transition as cap plates did
beginning about 1837-1838, with the single die strike plate yielding to
the composite plate, and applied devices being attached to oval,
rectangular, or rectangular "clipped corner" plates. While some single
die plates were made and worn <span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103"></a>(p. 103)</span> after 1840, no composite types
that predate 1835 are known. The following group of shoulder-belt plates
are typical of those that first appeared about 1840. Of these, several
continued unchanged through the Civil War and into the 1870's and
1880's.</p>

<p>This unusually large, oval, brass plate with the letters "<span class="smcap">C G</span>" in silver
applied with wire fasteners is another of that sizable group of lettered
insignia that cannot be attributed definitely to a particular
organization. The "<span class="smcap">C G</span>" may stand variously for City Guard, Cleveland
Greys, Charleston Guard, or some other organization. With a stock of
oval and rectangular blanks and a set of lettering and number-cutting
dies, an almost limitless combination of plates could be turned out by a
single manufacturer.</p>

the seal of the State of New York<a id="footnotetag133" name="footnotetag133"></a><a href="#footnote133" title="Go to footnote 133"><span class="smaller">[133]</span></a> applied with wire fasteners&mdash;is a
copy, with minor changes, of the bevelled plate prescribed for the
Regular Establishment in 1839. Distinctly an officer's plate, it would
have been appropriate for artillery or staff.</p>


<h4>SHOULDER-BELT PLATE, C. 1840</h4>

<p>This composite plate, struck in brass, has a bevelled, rectangular base
almost identical to the base of the 1839 regulation plate (see fig. <a href="#img088">86</a>).
The design consists of a silvered center ornament comprising a trophy of
flags, a sword, and a liberty pole surmounted by a wreath of laurel
inclosing fasces and a Federal shield with 26 stars in its canton. This
silver ornament is applied with four simple wire fasteners rather than
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104"></a>(p. 104)</span> soldered. Since the sun rays in the background radiate outward
not from the center but from the edge of a circle about 1-1/2 inches in
diameter, almost any desired center ornament could have been added to
the basic strike, or the plate could be struck a second time to add a
device integral to it. Thus the background portion of the specimen must
be considered a stock pattern. A print of the National Guards of
Philadelphia in <i>U.S. Military Magazine</i> for October 1841 shows an
officer wearing a similar plate. If the stars are significant, the plate
can be dated between 1837 and 1845.</p>

<p>In this plate, the center ornament used in the preceding specimen has
been struck directly in a rectangular, bevelled background. However, the
background of this plate has a stippled surface rather than a sunburst.
An interesting feature is that there are four slots punched through the
plate for the attachment of an additional device over the wreath and
shield. This is another of the many examples of how a unit might have an
insignia distinctive to itself at little extra cost. This plate is
obviously of a stock pattern. The national collections also contain a
die sample of this particular plate.</p>

pattern with the wire-fastened letters "<span class="smcap">S V G</span>" substituted for "<span class="smcap">U. S.</span>"

<p>The silver letters "<span class="smcap">S F</span>" applied with wire fasteners to the small brass
plate are most appropriate for the State Fencibles of Philadelphia, and
it is believed to have possibly been worn by that unit in the 1840's. A
print in the <i>U.S. Military Magazine</i><a id="footnotetag134" name="footnotetag134"></a><a href="#footnote134" title="Go to footnote 134"><span class="smaller">[134]</span></a> portraying this unit shows an
officer wearing a plate of an entirely different design, but since a
plate in this simple form would most probably have been worn by enlisted
personnel, and the soldier in the print is to be seen only from the
rear, such identification as to unit may be correct.</p>

<p>This unusually large silver-on-copper plate with its brass letters "<span class="smcap">B L

Infantry. The applied devices are attached with simple wire fasteners.
The date 1798 is believed to be the year of the original organization of
the unit, but the adjutant general of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
was unable to verify this.</p>

<p>The <i>New York Military Magazine</i> provides us with a strong clue in
identifying this clipped-corner, bevelled-edged brass plate with a
silver-on-copper tiger's head applied. In a sketch of the Light Guard of
New York it is related that, following a visit in 1836 to the Boston
Light Infantry, members of the company "adopted, as part of their
uniform, a silver tiger's head, to be placed on the breast plate, as a
further memento of the spirited and elegant corps whose guests they had
been."<a id="footnotetag135" name="footnotetag135"></a><a href="#footnote135" title="Go to footnote 135"><span class="smaller">[135]</span></a> This specimen is in agreement with that description.</p>

<p>An unusual manufacturing technique was used in making this plate. It was
struck in very heavy brass about 1/16 inch thick and the whole tinned;
then, all the tin on the obverse, except that on the crested helmet
device, was buffed away, giving the center ornament the appearance of
having been silvered. The specimen obviously was made for a particular
mounted unit, designation unknown. An interesting detail is the letter
"<span class="smcap">A</span>" on the half-sunburst plate of the dragoon helmet device.</p>

<p>This plate, which is of brass with a cast, white-metal likeness of
Washington applied with wire fasteners, may well have belonged to either
the Washington Greys of Philadelphia or the unit of the same designation
of Reading, Pennsylvania. Prints of these two organizations in <i>U.S.
Military Magazine</i><a id="footnotetag136" name="footnotetag136"></a><a href="#footnote136" title="Go to footnote 136"><span class="smaller">[136]</span></a> show profiles on the shoulder-belts plates,

<p>This brass plate with its wire-applied devices obviously belonged to an
Irish-group Militia unit. The Huddy and Duval print of the Hibernia
Greens of Philadelphia<a id="footnotetag137" name="footnotetag137"></a><a href="#footnote137" title="Go to footnote 137"><span class="smaller">[137]</span></a> definitely depicts an Irish harp on both the
shoulder-belt plate and the cap plate, but the motto "<span class="smcap">ERIN GO BRAGH</span>" is
not included. The specimen would have been suitable for several Militia
organizations, such as the Irish Jasper Greens of Savannah, Georgia, and
the Montgomery Hibernia Greens. Its devices are wire-applied, and it
possibly was a stock pattern.</p>

<p>Letters signifying the New England Guards are embossed on a shield of
white metal that is attached to this brass plate, which has scalloped
corners. Although the officer depicted in the Huddy and Duval print of
the New England Guards<a id="footnotetag138" name="footnotetag138"></a><a href="#footnote138" title="Go to footnote 138"><span class="smaller">[138]</span></a> wears a waist belt rather than a shoulder
belt for his sword, the soldier standing in the background is shown with
crossed shoulder belts. Thus, this plate may have been an item of
equipment for enlisted personnel rather than for officers.</p>


<h4>SHOULDER-BELT PLATE, MASSACHUSETTS, C. 1840</h4>

<p>Although the white-metal arm and sword on wreath device wired to this
large brass plate immediately identifies the origin of the specimen as
Massachusetts, the considerable heraldic license taken by this
insignia-maker is only too evident. When the Massachusetts State seal
was first adopted in 1780, the blazonry of the crest was given as
follows: "On a Wreath a dexter Arm cloathed and ruffled proper,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108"></a>(p. 108)</span> grasping a Broad Sword...."<a id="footnotetag139" name="footnotetag139"></a><a href="#footnote139" title="Go to footnote 139"><span class="smaller">[139]</span></a> The designer has placed the
arm in armor and replaced the "broad sword" with a scimiter-like, edged
weapon. The use of the crest of a state seal or coat of arms to indicate
the state was common usage, with the eagle-on-half-globe of New York
providing an excellent example. This plate would have been appropriate
for wear by any Massachusetts unit, and is thus considered to have been
a stock pattern.</p>


<h4>SHOULDER-BELT PLATE, SOUTH CAROLINA, C. 1840</h4>

</div>

<p>The silver palmetto tree identifies this as a South Carolina plate. The
letters "<span class="smcap">L</span>" and "<span class="smcap">A</span>" are subject to several interpretations, the more
probable being "Light Artillery." The devices are attached with simple
wire fasteners, and the basic brass plate can be considered to have been
a stock item adaptable to any number of units.</p>

<p>This brass, lead-backed badge bears no devices that would assist in
identifying it as to unit, and its general composition would have made
it appealing to more than one Militia organization. It is considered a
stock pattern. The stars-on-belt motif, forming the border of the oval,
is very unusual, as are the 14 arrows in the eagle's left talon and the
star beneath its beak. The center eagle device is applied with simple
wire fasteners.</p>

<p class="p2"> Following the War with Mexico, many State Militia, especially those in
the south, began using their state coats of arms as the principal
devices on their waist-belt plates. The plates for officers followed the
earlier pattern for Regulars, a round device clasped within an outer
ring. Plates of enlisted personnel more often were rectangular, but
there were many exceptions. The following series includes examples of
both types.</p>

<p>The old Alabama State seal with a representation of a map of the State
hung from a tree trunk, as depicted on the inner ring of this cast-brass
waist-belt plate, became obsolete after the Civil War when the
"reconstruction" government changed the device to that of an eagle
resting on a Federal shield. Some years later, however, the original
seal, in somewhat modified form, was readopted. Although made in the
early 1850's, plates of this type were worn by personnel of the
Confederate States Army throughout the Civil War. Many plates of this
same basic pattern were made in England and run through the blockade.</p>

bearing the central elements of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name="page110"></a>(p. 110)</span> California State seal
indicate that it was made after statehood was granted in 1850 but before
1858 when Minnesota became the 32d State. Actually, this design for the
arms of the State was adopted in anticipation of admission to the Union,
on October 2, 1849.<a id="footnotetag140" name="footnotetag140"></a><a href="#footnote140" title="Go to footnote 140"><span class="smaller">[140]</span></a> The ornate design of this plate is more
characteristic of the 1840's than later, indicating that it was made
very early in the 1850's.</p>


<h4>WAIST-BELT PLATE, FLORIDA, C. 1850</h4>

<p>The palm tree, standing alone, although sometimes mistaken for the
palmetto of South Carolina, is representative of the State of Florida.
Thus, this plate is ascribed to Florida Militia, about 1850. The late
Richard D. Steuart, of Baltimore, Maryland, an outstanding authority on
Confederate equipment and accoutrements, was firm in asserting that this
pattern should be ascribed to Florida.</p>

<p>While cast-brass plates of this type were first made in the early
1850's, their use continued for 20 years or more after that decade. The
principal device on this specimen is taken from the arms of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The form of the plate is identical to the
pattern of the eagle-wreath plate adopted by the Regulars in 1851.</p>

<p>The star device was used by the Militia of both Texas and Maine, as well
as by volunteer units located in other states; thus, this plate cannot
be ascribed to any particular geographical area. Plates such as this,
with the silver wreath of laurel and palm, are patterned directly after
the basic plate prescribed for officers of the Corps of Engineers in
1841. They would have been stock items for general sale.</p>

Militia. Obviously a stock pattern, it would also have been sold to
Militia organizations in other parts of the country. As in the case of
most round plates, the outer ring is of a standard design; variation in
pattern would occur on the inner ring.</p>

on the waist belt and on cartridge boxes just prior to and during the
Civil War. Small square plates with silver, Old English letters "<span class="smcap">NY</span>" are
included in the 1900 catalog of the Warnock Uniform Co. of New <span class="pagenum"><a id="page112" name="page112"></a>(p. 112)</span>

laurel is taken directly from the plate authorized for general and staff
officers of the Regular Establishment in 1832. While this is thought to
be the plate for the New York City Guards, for whom a matching
shoulder-belt plate is known, there is the possibility that it was also
worn by uniformed police of the 1850's.</p>

<p>This plate bears another variation of the Ohio State arms. Here, the
arms lie within a wreath as prescribed for Regular general and staff
officers in 1832. The entire specimen is cast in brass; the wreath, sun,
arrows, canal wall, and hull of keelboat are silvered.</p>

<p>Officers of the Pennsylvania Volunteer Militia wore plates of this type
in the 1850's, although most were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113"></a>(p. 113)</span> discarded in 1861 when
Pennsylvania troops went into active Federal service. The outer ring,
with floral wreath design, has been modified to give the appearance of a
solid rectangle. Another plate in the national collections bears the
letters "<span class="smcap">P V M</span>" with the conventional outer ring.</p>

<p>Just prior to 1850 there were two Militia units in Philadelphia using
the letters "<span class="smcap">P G</span>" to indicate organizational designation&mdash;the
Philadelphia Guards and the Philadelphia City Greys. This brass-cast
plate is believed to have been worn by the Philadelphia Guards, whose
buttons were marked "<span class="smcap">P G</span>." The buttons worn by the Philadelphia City
Greys carried the three letters "<span class="smcap">P C G</span>."<a id="footnotetag143" name="footnotetag143"></a><a href="#footnote143" title="Go to footnote 143"><span class="smaller">[143]</span></a></p>

<p>The letters and device on this rather unusual brass plate make its
identification easy. The letters stand for the Providence [R.I.] Marine
Corps Artillery; the date 1801 is the unit's original organization date.
The crossed cannon indicate Militia artillery. The letters and numerals
are of white metal and brazed to the plate. The brass crossed cannon are
affixed with wire fasteners. The reverse is fitted with a broad tongue
and two wire hooks for attachment.</p>

<p>Although this specimen is not so old as the similar South Carolina plate
described previously (fig. <a href="#img164">162</a>), it is believed to date about 1850. The
plate proper is of rolled brass, and the applied device, which comprises
well-known elements of the arms of South Carolina, is struck in brass
and attached by means of two wire staples and leather thongs.</p>

<p>This plate, carrying the Virginia seal, was made about 1850 for wear by
officers. Similar plates made by British manufacturers during the Civil
War to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>(p. 114)</span> be run through the blockade are generally
distinguishable by their unusually sharp, clean die work. The center
device of this specimen is struck in brass and brazed in place; the
remainder of the plate is brass-cast.</p>

<p>The unit for which this plate was made cannot be precisely identified.
It is reasonable to assume that there were several Militia organizations
called "Gray Guards." The central "<span class="smcap">G</span>" probably indicates "Company G."
The whole is cast brass.</p>

<p>This plain brass plate of unusually fine manufacture is very definitely
a stock pattern which could have been sold without ornament or, as was
more likely, with a center device added by soldering or brazing. The
plate was cast in three pieces, with the round center brazed to the belt
attachment. It was bench-fitted, as indicated by the numbers on the
reverse of the inner and outer rings.</p>

<p>This is another stock pattern with company designation. In this case,
the numeral "1" has been applied with wire fasteners rather than cast

<p>This is another typical stock pattern with the eagle-on-shield device
surrounded by 13 5-pointed stars as the center ornament. It is cast in

<p>The musician's lyre has never been strictly a military ornament, being
widely worn by civilian bands; thus, this plate cannot precisely be
identified as military or nonmilitary. Unlike most plates of this type
and period, the entire piece is struck in brass rather than cast.</p>

<p>The letters "<span class="smcap">T C B</span>" on this brass-cast plate open wide the doors of
conjecture as to interpretation. Possible combinations range from
Trenton City Blues (if such a Militia organization ever existed) to Troy
Cornet Band, a nonmilitary unit. Plates such as this can seldom be
positively identified.</p>

<p>This plate is known both in heavy metal stamping and in thin, cheap
brass. Examples of the latter type appear to have been struck in the
period of the 1890's from a die then 50 years old. A plate similar to
this one has been excavated from a Civil War battlefield site. A stock
pattern, the design was obsolete for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117"></a>(p. 117)</span> issue to Militia before
the Civil War, but it is known to have been continued almost to the end
of the century for use by groups such as secondary school cadet corps.</p>

<p class="p2"> The shoulder-belt plates worn in the 1850's were little changed from
those of the preceding decade. In the Regular Establishment the shoulder
belt and plate for officers had been discarded in favor of the waist
belt for carrying the sword, but Militia officers&mdash;bound by no
regulations&mdash;continued to wear the shoulder belt. Enlisted personnel
wore at least one shoulder belt, and in many cases used two belts, which
crossed, one belt carrying the cartridge box and the other the bayonet
and scabbard. Mounted Militia sometimes wore the saber on a waist belt
and the carbine cartridge box on a shoulder belt. It is interesting to
note that the custom of using elements of state seals on waist-belt
plates was not followed to any great extent in the embellishment of
shoulder-belt plates except in the Southern States.</p>

<p>In size and pattern this plate is exactly like that prescribed for the
Regular Establishment in 1841, substituting the arms of South Carolina
for the eagle. It possibly may date as early as 1845. Made for South
Carolina Militia, plates similar to this were worn during the Civil War
and several have been recovered from battlefield sites. The specimen is
struck in brass and the reverse filled with lead. It has three bent-wire
fasteners imbedded in the reverse, which indicates that it was
decorative rather than functional. A similar plate with elements of the
Virginia State seal is known. Modern reproductions of both are being
sold.</p>

<p>A popular stock pattern of the 1850's, this design with the silver
numeral "1" on a rectangle of rolled brass was worn for at least half a
century after it first appeared. Similar plates are known with all
numerals through 9 and a few higher numbers. Other plates of the same
general type are known with company letters "<span class="smcap">A</span>" through "<span class="smcap">M</span>." The plate
proper is fitted with two brass wire hooks and a medium width tongue,
indicating a functional use. The numeral is attached by means of two
staples with leather thongs reeved through on the reverse of the plate.</p>

<p>This rolled-brass plate with its silver "<span class="smcap">TC</span>" monogram is presently
unidentified. In the national <span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118"></a>(p. 118)</span> collections there is a Militia
helmet with the same device used as part of the cap plate; also known is
another insignia, comprising the monogram alone, that was used as a
cartridge-box device. <i>New York Military Magazine</i> for July 17, 1841,
refers to the elegant armory of the Troy [N.Y.] Corps where the Light
Guard of New York had been visitors. This plate may have been an
insignia of that organization. The monogram is affixed with staples and
leather thongs, and the plate proper carries a large safety pin soldered
to the reverse for purely decorative attachment. It is unknown whether
the safety pin fasteners are contemporary with the plates to which they
are attached. Rudimentary safety pins were known in Egypt before Christ,
but they apparently did not appear in America until the 1830's and
1840's. Walter Hunt patented the first American safety pin in 1849.<a id="footnotetag144" name="footnotetag144"></a><a href="#footnote144" title="Go to footnote 144"><span class="smaller">[144]</span></a></p>

majors and sometimes by band leaders. During at least part of the Civil
War, baldrics were worn by some aides-de-camp, and the 1902 uniform
regulations specified them for Signal Corps officers. This specimen and
the one that follows are the earlier of several examples in the national
collections; they fall in the early 1850's. The shield, suspended from a
lion's mouth by small chains, carries an eagle with a shield on its
breast. The stars and edge of clouds, above, are somewhat similar to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>(p. 122)</span> those on the 1851 regulation waist-belt plate. The whole is
superimposed on a three-quarter sunburst. Both the lion's head and the
shield are fitted with simple wire fasteners for attachment.</p>


<h4>BALDRIC DEVICE AND BALDRIC, C. 1850</h4>

<p>The device is attached to a red, gold-edged-embroidered baldric worn by
the drum major of the 72d New York Militia during the Civil War but
believed to ante-date 1861. The brass shield, with ebony drum sticks, is
suspended from an eagle of the 1834 Regular Army pattern for wear as a
cap device. The shield, convex with beveled edges, is very similar to
waist-belt and shoulder-belt plates of about 1850.</p>

<p class="p2"> Few Militia gorgets are known, and this scarcity leads us to believe
that few were made and worn, despite the Militia's love for the "gay and
gaudy." Still, some units did adopt them, and officers of the Portland
[Maine] Rifle Corps were still wearing them <span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name="page123"></a>(p. 123)</span> in the late
1850's.<a id="footnotetag145" name="footnotetag145"></a><a href="#footnote145" title="Go to footnote 145"><span class="smaller">[145]</span></a> As a military symbol for officers, the gorget passed its
zenith in the late 18th century. Gorgets were worn during the War of the
Revolution by both American and British officers, and the British also
gave them to Indian chiefs as marks of authority. Officers in at least
one regiment of the Regular Establishment wore them as part of their
regulation dress about the turn of the 19th century, but they were not a
part of the prescribed uniform during or after the War of 1812.</p>


<h4>GORGET, C. 1821(?)</h4>

<p class="center"><i>USNM 60311-M (S-K 67B). Figure 274.</i></p>

<p class="smcap">Figure 274</p>
</div>

<p>This gorget, of gilded brass, is of 2-piece construction. The
eagle-on-clouds, very similar to cockade eagles worn in 1808-1821, is
attached by four wire fasteners rather than brazed. The engraved edging
on the gorget proper is rather crudely done. Although composite insignia
did not come into general use until the mid-1830's, it seems reasonable
to assume that this particular design of the eagle device applied to the
chapeau might equally have been applied to a gorget. A similar specimen
in the national collections has a silver-on-copper eagle instead of a
brass one.</p>


<h4>GORGET, C. 1830-1840</h4>

<p class="center"><i>USNM 60310-M (S-K 67A). Figure 275.</i></p>

<a id="img277" name="img277"></a>

<img src="images/img277.jpg" width="350" height="238" alt="" title="">
<p class="smcap">Figure 275</p>
</div>

<p>This gorget is of 3-piece construction, the specimen proper being of
brass and the wreath and eagle of gilded brass applied with wire
fasteners. Although the eagle is of the early "on-clouds" design, the
feel of the piece is later, and this, together with the rather wide
crescent indicate that it belongs to the period of the 1830's and
1840's.</p>


<h4>GORGET, STATE FENCIBLES, NEW YORK, C. 1840-1850</h4>

<p class="center"><i>USNM 60309-M (S-K 66). Figure 276.</i></p>

<a id="img278" name="img278"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img278.jpg" width="350" height="258" alt="" title="">
<p class="smcap">Figure 276</p>
</div>

<p>This brass gorget, with wreath and letters in applied silver, is an
example of one of the later <span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name="page124"></a>(p. 124)</span> types worn by Militia. The letters
"<span class="smcap">S F</span>" are interpreted as "State Fencibles," and the "Excelsior" buttons
on the ends of the crescent identify the origin of the unit as New York
State. Fencibles were basically troop units organized for home defense
only. There was a volunteer Militia company called the "State Fencibles"
in New York City as early as 1800. It apparently lost its identity as
such in 1847 or 1848 when the organization split, half entering the 8th
Regiment and half entering the 9th Regiment of New York State
Militia.<a id="footnotetag146" name="footnotetag146"></a><a href="#footnote146" title="Go to footnote 146"><span class="smaller">[146]</span></a></p>

<b><a href="#footnotetag18">18</a></b>: Act of January 1813 (<i>Military Laws</i>, pp. 238-240). There
is some confusion as to just how many infantry regiments were organized
and actually came into being. The Act of January 29, 1813, authorized
the President to raise such regiments of infantry as he should see fit,
"not exceeding twenty." It seems that 19 were actually formed, made up
partly of 1-year men and partly of 5-year men. There are 46 regiments
listed in the Army Register for January 1, 1815, and it is known that
several volunteer regiments were designated as units of the Regular
Establishment and that a 47th and a 48th were redesignated as lower
numbered units when several regiments were consolidated because of low
recruitment rate. Mahon (in "History of the Organization of the United
States Infantry") is not clear on this point. There is an organizational
chart of the Army for this period in the files of the Office of the
Chief of Military History, Department of the Army.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
